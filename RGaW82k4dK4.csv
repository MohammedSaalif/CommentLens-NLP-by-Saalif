@peace389,非常好的建议 还有一点 相信相信的力量😄
@Noidnoid-s3r,"Thanks, bro."
@afayes,"Great advice for perfectionists. I however disagree with one thing, other devs to care about how your code looks as they will maintain it. It is not uncommon for a dev to come a accross terribly written that causes a lot suffering. We need a balance between not being too perfect and not being careless either"
@BRAAMER702,Thanks. Learning Python on my own and  the video is great.
@chrydan,Thank you so much. Wise words
@Froogieboi-b2d,isn't all of that common sense? i mean ive been learning code (trying to) for two weeks after school

@shaikasma4202,"Thank a million ! 
Every point of the video is the thing which I hope wanted to listen and know that has never been told"
@kcelma746,Last : most developers spend their time looking at legacy code and fixing bugs since most of the projects are maintenance and not from scratch
@blockchaingist,"You don't have to know everything 😅.
Just start building"

@SiNKarnage,"I was a coder without realizing I was coding back in the early 2010s when I built this bot script with a program to automate a Online JRPG on my computer while I sleep. I shared my codes alot with a community to score points towards keeping that program alive but after many game patches and updates Ive lost touch with it and stop playing and never looked back. 

Fast forward to today I'm trying to get back into coding with Python to automate my livelihood right now."
@kimhwanhoon,"I’m from Korea, 3 years ago I didn’t even know what HTML really was, and now I’m working in Paris as a frontend dev having almost a senior role. My goal is to work in the biggest cities in the world, like Manhattan or San Francisco. I’ll keep learning hard and working hard to achieve my dreams, I don’t want to worry about spending money in my life, let’s set up a goal and keep going forward !!!"

@LaibaQaiser-wb2og,"the googling point.. I used to feel myself dumb, whenever had to google any quick syntax.. but now.. it feels cool😎❤"
@ニコラウスフランツ,"I am wondering if some people memorize all of the code or how the hell they come up with a new type of code that never existed, is that possible? for the first question it's been answered so thank you, but for the second question is it possible and how? I'm new and a student and this question always bugged me out and make me lose interest in coding overall."

@sumwonche5688,"In a burn-out phase here (stalled for a month), having worked on the same project solo for 17 months (still several months to finish), no vacations, no life...Trying to exit that state currently. Fortunately I work out a bit - though not as consistently as I should, but it gives me endorphins that prevent me from having a complete breakdown."

""No one needs your codes""

Thank you so much sir"
@TheCentaury,"Point 1: correct. Point 2: correct. Point 3: correct. Point 4: correct. Point 5: correct. Point 6: correct. Point 7: incorrect (it's not due to development, it's due to other parameters like deadlines) 

I'll add one point : Don't trust others blindly even microsoft... You dynamically add a control like a TreeView in your application and then you dynamically add datas into it but a lot of data and then you see that your application is unresponsive while data is being added and even slowed down... You check on Microsoft and see a lot of examples telling you how to add nodes and so on... But these samples are lie. They work with very small projects... Then you have to find yourself that deactivating the treeview, adding the data and then reactivating the treeview is the solution and nowhere on microsoft they will tell you that.

Another example : Add Windows Forms to your powershell project and run it. When it's processing something, you can't move the form on the screen, it's like blocked... Solution, make a tick loop with asynchronous jobs. You can then move your form while code is running."

@lordmuaddib,"polishing is important. what you must not do is polish the chunk of code you are currently developing and get stuck there. make things work and go forward first. then you can go back, clean the code and work on the details once the whole structure is up"
@guillermogallo8016,"Thank you very much, I agree completely."
@Somedeveloper5329,"No one cares if you’re using a clever algorithm either.

Most developers have at least once felt the urge to write some advanced sorting algorithm ”like a real programmer”. Please don’t. Just write a simple solution that’s easy to reason about. It’s far easier to maintain in the long run.

There’s no shame in writing simple code."

@molokochris,"I feel like you're talking about me.. 😅I've got projects that I really love working on but haven't been able to finish just because I feel they aren't ""perfect enough"". for some reason, I have this idea that they have to look perfect and the code has to be perfect before I can consider them done and ready for the world. At the moment, Im not motivated to write code and have doubts about this app development career. I think you just made me realise that I'm the one standing in the way of myself.. Thanks for this.."

@CleanCodr,"Agree to most of it but I think the part where you said ""Nobody cares about your code"" is not entirely true.

@sid2945,"Almost all of those points relates to my work life. At one point I started thinking is it what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I was obsessed to write a perfect code which the client/manager doesn’t care. I learnt this in a hard way. Sometimes I felt super frustrated that I don’t know everything of what I am doing and thinking that I left behind in the race.

@nebsthelegend1502,Thank you so much for the coding tips in this video! Problem solving and taking a break after coding was what I took away.
@SARUTO740,"i came across this video while taking a break from a huge project that while i am not that experienced in i am doing it anyway as a surprise for my sister and making sure no other people suffer the same i did before i picked up this project in C++ and it's a WhatsApp transfer app from Android To IOS and the code after trying my hardest after like damn near a week at this point the whole code works it's just the GUI and the UI that have a Problem which i am hopefully fixing in QT Creator and so i just wanna say thank you cuz while working on this project i realized that everything you said that would happen is correct and i have been doing it already without the video but for me it confirmed that i was at least in the right direction and btw the project is for my sister and it's a surprise for her, and yes i will release this project on github once i am sure everything works for everyone and making an installer for it, basically thank you for this video cuz it confirmed i was going in the right direction (btw i am 16)"

From my experience, just know and understand the syntax, even if not all then learn the principle of design in that language. Like in php now we are in PSR-12 standard, start applying it quickly as you dive into real life project little by little…….

@iGoodDriver,"id encourage younger people to ignore programming. I recently created a content managed blog using tiptap, astro and node/express. I have never used node/express in my career, just got AI to do the foundation work for me and I did the rest.

@ItsSpagett,Not a professional. Perfection is sure the biggest trap but.. SOLID ? make it work than make it readable? Sure nobody cares about my code except me in two months.

@arti5769,"I went on discord as I needed help with some topic. The other guy helped me with my actual problem, but also gave some tips and adjusted some code of mine which I didn't even ask. He made such MINOR (and unnecessary) changes and said, why this is better and this is better. While he tried to be nice and helpful I felt like I needed to learn to code perfect and better. Everything had to be perfect. And as I'm a perfectionist myself, that hurt my progress a lot. So, keep it mind guys, don't overdo it when helping others. Cheers."

@kevinrickey3925,"Hi Friend.  I'd have a few items to add, but you hit it on the head.  I used to program more than I do now.  Now a days it's configuring linux file servers and Doing full everything on Streaming  Web servers using FSTAB, Javascript, PHP and so many libraries I cant count anymore.  I started with TRS-80 BASIC back in 1980.  I maxed out BASIC language, too slow.  I then taught myself the Zilog Z80 architecture, addressing modes and instruction set.  I graduated with computer programming honors in 1982.  I got an Atari box, so I had to learn the MOS 6502 chip.  Wow, the architecture was different on a 6502 than a Z-80.  I took me 6 months to really get the hang of Zero page addressing and how to make the 6502 really perform.  Now I deal with intel x86 and x64 code.  and Linux servers and Photoshop and web page development.   I build the boxes from scratch, configure the CLI Linux servers then I gotta put in SSL, streaming engines, I'm 61 now.  I still do it all as a hobby.  Resursive DNS Pi-Hole?  fucking OPNsense firewalls.  rooting phones..  I agree with everytihng you say, and more.  Love you!"

@timetraveller9271,"The one hour of tutorial and 4 hours of problem solving really makes a big difference for who ever is starting new, because that is how our brain reminders stuff and works."
@sawmkcsaw,"Engineer with 15+ years of experience here. I agree with almost everything you said, bro — solid take.
But I just hope that the guy with 1.7M views didn’t take the “perfection is a myth” idea too literally.
Yes, perfection is impossible — but we should still aim for it. Not to the point of burnout or over-engineering, of course, but striving for clean, maintainable code is critical. Why? Because it forces you to look at solutions from different angles and often leads to better long-term outcomes.
More importantly: maintenance costs.
No one wants to join a company and be stuck fixing a 1,000-line stored procedure or deciphering a component where someone scattered boolean flags across multiple files — just to change a button color that should’ve taken 5 minutes, but now takes 5 hours.
As devs, we wouldn’t want to work on that mess. And we shouldn’t leave it for others, either.
That “I won’t be here in 5 years, not my problem” mindset? It’s toxic. The client may not care about code quality, but the company should — because in the end, they’re paying for human hours. And I doubt they want to spend hundreds of dollars on something that should’ve been a 5-minute task.
So yeah — most of what you said is spot on, but I’d add this:
Always aim for clean, maintainable code. Maybe not perfection — but definitely professionalism."
@AmanoritseworTemituopeSamuel,"""The one who last"""
@AloanMoreira1,"And here is 10 years shrunk in less than a minute:
1- you don´t need to know everything
2- learn how to learn code
3- perfection is a trap

5- the real skill is problem solving
6- people care about what your code does
7- protect your energy agains burnout"
@drewxx8527,"The first part is true, you don't actually need to learn everything in java, just the basics and advance OOP and other link and hashmaps, the real current task is your career, since I'm a java developer I joined android studio so I focused my java into Android studio so I learn native and compatibility and Gradle while design can learn later."

@pharmokan,if you're on a serious project you'll never get away with pushing code that just works. You'll get belittled by a jerk TA or lead and they'll backstab you at your performance review and you'll get thrown off the project and die from depression.
@veryStupidInternet,"Here's the 10 things:

*You don’t need to know everything
* Learn how to learn (build, don’t just watch)
* Perfection is a trap: ship it anyway
* You’ll never feel ready, start anyway
* The real skill is problem solving, not memorizing
* Nobody cares about code elegance, only results
* Burnout is real, protect your energy
* Value comes from working solutions, not vanity code
* Confidence comes from doing, not waiting
* Productivity is about sustainability, not grinding"
@waltershowalter,"I would say that ""Nobody Cares About Your Code,"" is 40%-75% true. I've worked at firms where people are very nitpicky and where the caliber of coder was 10x at FAANG or/and Ivy League level. So yes, there companies and colleagues that just want it to work but there's a healthy percentage that are very nitpicky about all the small details and look at both sides of the coin."
@Raidom,"Yeah but when you're saying to go for the dev job, do you mean even if they require more experience than I have ?"
@EmadRad-j5f,cool thanks
@enricosci-filive7789,I wish i had known that i was stuck over 5 years...

@tophalafawy,Burn-out is real I enrolled in a course a year ago almost everyone there had taken a precourse for this course and I was from the few who didn't take it so I entered the course at the start I was one of the best there bur at the end of the year I had a burn out and I stopped studying for the last 1/10 period of the course people who didn't even have half my grades in the middle of the course exam passed me just because I didn't give my self breaks from time to time
@eebiru657,"It’s been 3 months, and I feel stuck in the same loop. Knowing isn’t about memorizing everything; it’s about doing it and enjoying the process. I’m still a 4th-year BSIT student building my 5th app. The capstone project!  Throughout the journey  I learned 5 programming languages (Java, Python, PHP, C++, and JavaScript), and it’s actually fun. I used to think YouTube could help me finish it in one go, but no. Here’s a tip: read the documentation! and Don't be shy using A.I ( not to build the entire app but to learn from it. )"

@dorszslowacki8450,"""No one cares what your code looks like, they only cares if it's working."" - that's a half truth. Yes, they may not care about the code per se, but care if you can adapt it to changing requirements without taking ages or messing things up (and I mean real pivots not button color changes). They may also care if they can bring someone else to help on short notice, because the timelines changed. That's when keeping the code clean and maintainable pays off. You will indeed hardly ever get paid for doing it, but doing it will help you stay in demand."

@a.z.b.1916,"Here is one more advice. Don't think you can stick to one technology all the time.
On every project you will be required to do something that is out of your comfort zone. 
You wont be able to get away just saying: ""sorry I am a FE dev, I dont do deployments....""
Truth is that most project are moving towards devops engineering where you will be required to do everything, including FE, BE, CI/CD, writing professional documentation,  discuss development strategies with client while also recommending solutions that can save them more money, handling clusters and production database, writing automated tests and much more.
And if you not fancy any of these you will definitely be in the next wave of roll offs"

@handshake_failed,"If it were as simple as you say, inserting a comma in the wrong place would be corrected by the compiler. But that's impossible because it requires a deeper understanding of the code's expectations.. The compiler won't guess what you meant it demands precision. And precision means taking into account many factors you don't even realize need to be built in to get real output data. The factors themselves must be of a specific size, and their duration is sometimes dependent on other factors. So, that's precision, and you need to be aware of this because one comma in the wrong place makes the entire precise process less precise.

Next time, think about what you're saying with this cooking analogy;/. There's no compiler where you insert basic function blocks, define the framework for their exchange of information and the expected results, and then the compiler modifies the code to meet those expectations. This is possible through AI, but sometimes it takes many weeks of repeating many blocks over and over again to find the desired solution. 

The concept of debugging, printf(), console.log(), is also poorly described even by advanced programmers. It's merely feedback to the terminal about whether a given line of code executed according to conditions. You talk about the importance of debugging, but you can't elaborate."

@philipparker1319,"20+ years dev and 15+ QA here. Getting past QA is not an exam. It's a collaboration. QA knows your code won't be perfect. It's QAs job to define the tests and required test data to prove the code operates correctly within specified use cases. None of this should be a secret. You can ask for guidance. The smart devs would always ask me to create test data for them early to use in their unit tests. There would be some 'interesting' edge cases and failure cases in there, which the devs would 'fix' before it even went into QA. And when it did, it would sail through. Which saves me having to raise bugs and all that admin. ;-)"
@axui_2,دخلونا نتعلم هسة وكتها تطفون النت
@1meewtwo1,this really helped me out
@Fanchiotti,"For those who are starting to work or study in this field I would also add two more tips:
1-always document and save your codes into a git repository, or cloud, or even on multiple hard drives. Doesn't matter if the code is stupid or looks stupid, it's the manifestation of your time and effort and if lost will never come back. Also, people would be surprised on how many times most coders rewrote the same functions and classes again and again. Save your time and save your effort.

2-get a decent template of a project in your language and use it for your codes. Most people start learning and don't care much about the project structure (just leave source codes, compiled files, documentation and build scripts on same place). It's importante to find or build a decent project structure and keep using it, because it's what professional coders do on the industry. 
When I was an undergraduate and also a graduate in C.S. I didn't have this structure. Then I joined some companies and learned how to keep my code organized and well structured. And let me tell you, it made all the difference. So if you are starting, ask some coder you know who was more experience for some direction on this project structure.

So that's it. I hope someone who's learning reads this and it helps them."
@rickloyd8208,"Great video and suggestions! I completely agree with all of them, except for the emphasis on code quality. If you encounter a client who doesn't prioritize code quality, then meet their needs but advise them that future changes or feature additions might feel like starting the project from scratch.

After 25 years of experience (I still think I do not know enough to apply for ...), I've only prioritized code structure in the last five years, thanks to Uncle Bob and others. This is why I don't entirely agree with avoiding perfectionism. I might spend a few days devising the most elegant solution, but once I have an idea, I can often implement it in about an hour, avoiding multiple failed attempts by thinking it through beforehand (which would take days). Work smart, not hard!

Naming is another crucial aspect; spending 10-15 minutes to name a function can save you hours when revisiting your code months later, especially in long-term projects.

However, I do agree that being able to write quick, rough code is essential for prototyping and testing ideas. Do this first to identify potential issues, then refactor. This leads to test-driven development, a skill worth mastering, but unless you have at least 10 years of experience, focus on developing other, more critical skills first."

@sammyfromsydney,"I have 30 years of software development experience. Some of  what you say and the general flavour of it is good. But some of the detail isn't quite right. 
1) People do care about the code. Ask anyone who's failed a code review because the code didn't conform to standards, or didn't include unit tests. 
2) Every tutorial you do should have a purpose. It's not about how many hours you spend on it. It's about what purpose it serves. Doing tutorial after tutorial to learn syntax isn't helpful. Just do one or 2. Then yes apply the knowledge. But learning the right way first will save you a very long time developing bad habits you have to break and producing junk that will cause problems.
3) The best coders are the one who are driven to solve the problems and bend the computer to their will.
4) Here's a really tough one to swallow: Sometimes you will build excellent solutions and they will be rejected for bureaucratic reasons. I've had excellent work thrown out for the most illogical reasons during my career. If this is happening often, you might want to consider what other opportunities are out there."

That point is difficult for me because I've got the impression it's depending on the context : if you work on a complexe project, being part of a team then I think the quality of the code is important to transmit meaning and help with the futur maintenance cycles. It even help yourself, up to a point, within your own project if you stop working on it for some time and you get back to it. This shouldn't be the first priority for sure, but in the long run I don't think it's a bad thing"

@lassebrustad,"I'm self-taught, but different from what you said in the video. I knew I had to figure out how to learn and gain experience, rather than just watching content about it. I didn't really experience burnout during the process of learning, even when I sat days in front of my PC to just write code and learn. I did literally sit up to 24+ hours straight regulary, just because I got so interested in it. Can't recommend that, but it worked fine for me.

Other than that, even tho I didn't mess up thinking too much about stuff, I understood that programming is like learning a language, didn't really focus on perfection like you talked about, was probably confident in my knowledge earlier than I should've been, learned based on problem solving/debugging rather than just searching for solutions, had nobody to talk about the code with and thus no focus on talking about the code.

I started my ""journey"" January 2017, after dropping out of school. Did study ICT, but lost motivation, as all I learned during the first 5 months was the Norwegian words used in the field (yes, I'm Norwegian) and other things wasn't great back then. My journey started as a userscript coder for a text based web game, after I developed both a very simple website with PHP and MySQL and a Discord bot using NodeJS for a clan on Clash Royale, the mobile game.

Fun fact, about a year after starting coding, I realized that I really knew little, when I then realized that NodeJS was what I developed the Discord bot in. Shortly after, I started playing a lot with NodeJS, and fell in love with it. Sure, JS isn't perfect, and debugging it can be pain, sometimes, but there was a time I literally felt more confident in JS, than my native language, Norwegian.

The last few years, I haven't really been coding a lot, but I've personally been focused more on hardware knowledge, networking, security, automation, and so on, and while I've been more focused on those things, I've rather kept my programming brain updated by helping a friend through his bachelor degree. By that, I've learned stuff about Java too. Not a lot, as I've been learning about multiple languages during the time since I begun learning programming."

I have been designing websites using WordPress, CSS and html, then learnt php because I wanted to build web applications not just static websites but later I changed to python. Currently learning python and Django and I am ready to start a simple application like inventory management system. I intent to use bootstrap since I understand for front end.

@Ph1lW0,"All of them. I wish somebody told me in computer science class - because I was not the fastest to solve the example tasks from the textbook because I was a bit more distracted - maybe by building a good interface as well. Also at the age of 12 I got told by some software company guy ""when you stay mediocre at math exams you can vacuum-clean our office at best"" which is this typical binary thinking I can see in some developers today.
Hence I long thought this was some sort of competition, there must be much better developers - and finally became a UX designer . But now I am ""The UX designer who also codes"". And I wore many hats before that - IT Administrator, Linux Webadmin, One-to-one IT-Support for elderly people. As you say it's about problem solving. Recently I had to build a custom backend. Did I need to hire a backend engineer? No, I consulted ChatGPT for architecture, pros/cons of different approaches, read documentation and built it. Am I a Backend Engineer myself now? Fullstack Developer? Did such categories exists 100 years ago? I don't like labels. Let's just build. Maybe I can become the CTO of my own company so I don't need to listen to anymore putting me into categories."

@LocksRevenge,"My experience has led me to believe that perfection is unattainable and should not be strived for in a majority of cases. I was in a fast paced industry (film/animation) before where features that where requested in the pipeline would ultimately take weeks or months to implement properly, and there were several instances where the production  has already shipped and yet the feature is still in discussion. It's better to get something in front of the artists in a state that gives them close to what they want with an added apology. It opens up the conversation and builds trust too. Perfect code doesn't matter to much for most cases because like you said ""nobody cares of your code""."

@johnvonachen1672,"In anyone’s career there are three things: money, respect, and impact.  People, your boss or users, only care about impact.  Your workmates, if you have any, more so care about your code.  That’s the respect part, partially.  You care about the money, but really all three.  And when I talk about money I mean more or less the right amount, not too little and not too much also.  If you get all three of those right, that is a successful career.  You will get some of those right and not others or in varying degrees."

@AllenTsuna,"Been a developer for over a year, and my current workplace has caused me to burn out to the point where I don't care if things go downhill or I get fired. While it felt nice that there are people who think similarly (at least 3 of these points were clear to me already), it's just not helping.

It makes me want to step away from coding for a few months, just going out there to touch grass etc, then finding another dev job.

The biggest reason for my burnout is that we have project managers and product owners, yet most of managing the project is left to us devs, and the project managers rarely reflect or try to improve things.

Things get built when the design isn't even signed off yet, then they stare at us devs like lost chicken when the client doesn't sign it and wants changes.
Things that were underplayed and agreed to before seeking a dev's opinion bite us in the ass and cause overtime and unnecessary stress.
No real project documentation. No feature documentation. All of it is purely in the form git, tickets/issues + comments.
No documentation for feature agreements with the client. Just a call and maybe a quick email sign-off, then that gets lost cos it was handled by someone who left the company.
It's also boring cos it's basically a platform and 99% of things are already built, just rethemed or shuffled around a bit or extended/improved slightly.

Made me wonder, is it me, or is it the company? Idk anymore, but I'm sick of it."
@qzwxecrv0192837465,My Java teacher in college allowed us to use the internet on a test if we were stuck. why? He said he even uses the internet for answers or ideas because he gets stuck.  It is how programmers program in the real world.  made sense to me

It enlightened me. 

Also, a BIG QUESTION: Every time I try to use an open-source code from GitHub; I get stuck and can't go further. for example, I build an api and database for a project management app. I told to myself let's use an open-source frontend admin Dashboard to save time not building one. BUT when I found the perfect project, it was so many files and so many code that I couldn't handle, to understand. therefor I regretted being there and lost the whole day thinking how they were able to build such flawless great app that I can't even read.

How and when You decide to use a code from somewhere else instead of writing your own code?"

A thing that I have noticed several times is when you spend hours trying to fix a bug, or try to get some piece of code to work I eventually get so tired that I'm forced to give and leave the code for the day. Then when I come back to work the next day I solve the problem within 15 minutes. I think its because one keeps thinking in a specific way while you're working with the problem. But coming back the next day, rested and with a new and fresh set of eyes, is what does the trick."

@FKGurdian,I strongly agree with you as a beginner trying to learn web development often feel same like this
@laravelerrors,"2:50 perfection might be a lie, but clean code is not, most people today still do not write clean code, what do i mean by that, is to decide a standard and stick with it in the context of tabs parentheses brackets how to write variables, when to use camelCase, PascalCase, or snake_case, i had issues writing postgres queries on code because postgres does not likes camelCase and some of the variable were written in such way, it creates more work while you are trying to develop, also variable names, try to keep consistent, it makes code easier to read, track, fix, write, etc, you pretty much do not have to think about those things because there is already a set agreement, sure people can be opinionated sometimes, but in any project i touch, i try to adhere to the preset of the project, there is a reason why the original coder wrote it that way, unless you realize it was really bad code, but i have work with old code and it not almost hard to follow, it almost looks spaghetti, although some algorithms were clever and some abstraction was reusable, a lot of times it was very inconsistent to the point that even with a MVC framework some view was on the controller and not the view, other logic was ion the model not the controller, etc...and with today's pretty tools it should not be an excuse for beginners, a lot of people might not like to use prettier tools, but i strongly suggest for beginners until you find your own way"
@krolu,"One of the best insights that I watched. I'm also a developer with almost 20 years of professional experience and many more years before first real dev job. I must say that every thing you pointed out here is a real thing, especially impostor syndrome which is the root of half of the problems mentioned. Even after so many years coding and writing almost everything from websites, backends, corpo projects, windows services, games, desktop apps and so on I still often think that everybody around me are just smarter. So learn from us and don't listen to it, go and start to code, learn how to solve problems by encountering them and be proud of yourself when you fix them. They will be often times that you will fill bad about your skills or even yourself, but this is NORMAL.
Cheers to all that want to become a dev."

@BitwiseMobile,"I taught myself assembler when I was 14 - this was pre-internet days - using DOS's debug.exe.  Later I discovered MASM, but at first I wrote small programs entirely in Debug, learning assembler through trial and error.  I had some help from the library, but it was 80% experimentation.  Learning high level languages after that was easy.  For me, learning any new language is just picking up the syntax to express the same underlying archetypes that we all use..  They come in many names, but a common name for those archetypes are ""programming patterns"".  As Jung said, language is only a vehicle for communicating archetypes. The archetypes matter — not the words themselves.  Programming languages are very similar.  In short, don't make it harder than it really is."

@fuzzylumpkins6034,"I helped develop computer software/games starting in 1994. I can tell you every game I ever worked on including he last. I will talk at length about the last game as it was for Netdevil for Lego and was Called Lego Universe. That game put me out of developing forever. Code is loads of typing then copy pasting as much as possible for as little cost as possible with no internal testing ever. 

 What I learned was studios were set up to fail at every step because bankrupting a studio is a write off. The teams I worked with on Dark Ages of Camelot were not the same team in 2 years. Anyone that did anything right was gone before it was a success. 

 Studios are a letter head to be closed down for profits if successful and blame if not, but still a tax write off. 

 All of my developing and coding days were done in the states and the minute I left in 2012 to work on Indy titles posted for sell on Steam, my life changed. I was being paid for my work based on my work and I started to learn from mistakes instead of fearing my contract would be up in 2 years.

 Do not work for triple A studios if you care about what you are doing, work for them if you are a throw away staff member no one cares about unless it pushes an agenda.

 edit: I wasted soo much time from 2006-2012 trying to make polished graphics and spent little to know time on execution because the studios I worked under did not care about content or replay, they all wanted minimal content that looked good in trailers and nothing more. 

 So if you are not good enough or confident enough to create your own project and you must work under the thumb of a big studio, know from the day you start , you are on the chopping block and nothing you think you are there for, will ever matter. You will simply reskin everything, copy paste quest, copy paste items and areas. Those of you that may want to know if I worked on larger MMOs than Dark ages of Camelot, the answer is yes and it was the worst experience of my life and I will never return to California based only on working with those reject drones. Thankfully for them microtransactions have kept that game alive 15 years longer than it deserves."

also try to write code in your down time, like during breaks when classes aren't in session. my peers who didn't touch C++ at all for 3 months struggled a little when we returned. i was happy to help them out, but unfortunately not everyone has friends they can depend on, and not everyone has friends in their field of study.

at the end of the day, if you like it enough that you can do it for money without sacrificing your physical and mental health, you should go after it regardless. write code"
@kreaxv,"You said, 'Nobody cares about your code.' That’s wrong!
Low-end jobs only care if it works.
High-end jobs care about efficiency too—if your code wastes resources, it could cost you your position."

@SaroorTypingOfficeKaramaBr,"You motivated me so hard, I’m starting right now… typing with tears dripping on my keyboard like Titanic part 2. 🚢😂"
@EvenTheDogAgrees,"""Nobody cares about your code"". Hard disagree. The most important person in the world does: me. He's also the person who I'll be f* over if I don't write clean, elegant and maintainable code, since he's the poor schmuck who'll have to extend and maintain it. Writing clean and elegant code is not just a vanity thing; it's what ensures the product you're building can survive years in production while evolving to changing user requirements. Perhaps you just write one-off web apps that need to run for a couple of months, and then they're retired, or perhaps you just do the initial delivery and it's someone else's problem after you're gone, but that's a real crappy attitude to bring to work."
@GeorgeStanmore,You can make it reusable when it comes to reusing it
@ismaeleTheBTT,"I share a similar experience, but I have a different take on the idea that ""Nobody cares about your code."" In a team setting, clean code with an intelligent and modular structure is important because it makes it much easier for other, often younger, developers to read and understand. This saves them time that can be used for other work. Customers often request changes that can cause problems, and with good code, you can confidently say, ""I need X days for that change."" This allows you to finish the work ahead of schedule, use the extra time to complete other tasks that are behind, and ultimately get paid for the work you did. Of course, it's all about finding the right balance and maintaining good ethics!"

@TerranVisitor,"Quite Well Said.  However, if you are developing critical software (aircraft, etc) - aiming for perfection is NOT optional.  The only thing I can add, learn machine code FIRST - it will empower you to understand the machine itself, and learn (and understand) languages quicker.  Additionally, learning actual OS calls helps a lot also - not to memorize - but to understand the infrastructure that underlays your language/script of choice."

@Westkane11,Great advice you give. I think you could also talk about how developers define requirements from the wishes of the clients like use cases and when delivering the product these use cases are used to verify that the product fulfills the requirements of the client. Now that is being a professional developer. Yes I know you talked about solving problems. But wouldn't it be interesting to talk a little about how it is done?

@Mr76Pontiac,"I've been a ""coder"" since the 80s.  Yeah, I was like 7 or 8 when dad got the first Commodore machine, but I fell in love with the 64 and still own that very exact machine and monitor and the three 1541 disk drives my dad bought new.  I learned the hard knocks very well on that machine and even today as a proper systems administrator for a world wide company.

#1> Foundational information is absolutely necessary.  Forget the language, remember the process.  I Google (Now ChatGPT) how to do some basic stuff
#2> I'm currently learning and documenting some Ansible playbooks.  I'm writing a set of documents on the modules I'd  be using regularly to reference.
#3> When you start at a programming language with a limited length of variable name (Two characters!) your choices are limited.  I still use ""for x:=0 to 10"" today.  Refactoring code is a later process.
#4> With how software changes, I found you're never going to know everything.  You can only dig into what's on the field right now, because next week, it's probably going to change.  EXPECT to have things changed.
#5> Modularization, small chunks, small functions/procedure, very specific tasks in code... This makes this so much easier to figure out if you throw intentional bad data at your SMALL routines.  Tracing, line by line.
#6> I kind of agree with this, but the programmer looking at your code in three months, you need some decent style in the code.  To START, yeah, the code will look horrible, but with refinement, you'll be able to get it so that you could be a couple years out and look at the code and figure out what it's supposed to do either just LOOKING at the code or reading the documentation and have faith your younger self knew what they were doing. ;)
#7> Burnout IS real.  Not only for coding, but for EVERYTHING you regularly do over and over again.  Distraction is necessary, diversion is necessary, stepping back for a little while is necessary.  If a part of the code doesn't work, remove it, stub it, know it's broken and move onto something else.  Your brains background processor will think on the problem and get you straight again eventually.  Even at 4am.  Been there too.  No cold sweat wake-up, but certainly have woken up with an AH-HA thought and went back to sleep."
@0ATHijs,This is why I use ai. Sometimes searching code snippets you just can't for the love of it find anything and then you just describe it in the msot braindead way to an llm and it somehow understands. It also gave me so many bad snippets that I now know how to debug code better than I  know how to write it.

@CitronMandX,"I'm a senior dev, and I hard-disagree with ""Nobody Cares About Your Code"". Your coworkers and your future self will care. And your clients will care in the long run if you write garbage, indirectly, because they'll start to wonder if it's normal that there are so many bugs and that it takes 3 weeks to make a small change. That being said, many devs definitely put too much of their ego into their code, and that's mostly a very bad and toxic habit. 

Otherwise good points."

@sadiriy,"I am a junior developer, but over the past five years I’ve read tons of code and experimented with different programming languages. Recently, I realized that the language I truly want to focus on is Java. Everything you shared in this video perfectly reflects what I often think about many so-called “middle” Java developers I encounter nowadays: they seem afraid, acting more like NPCs with no willingness to approach problems like real “detectives.” I believe I gained this perspective through my journey of exploring various languages, practicing, and reading a lot of code."

@Bungee75,"I mostly agree with you. Indeed even ugly code can solve a problem, but it's still good practice to write nice code, not for client for future you who will have to debug it. And most important of all leave comments/hints in the code to remind your future self what you meant with the code. Yes if this is one time gig, I get it, you'll never look at it again, but those are rare occurrences.

@psiEnergos,"""Seasoned"" developer here (20+), and the only point I'd like to add to is your ""nobody cares about your code"".  While I totally get the point you're making, its not entirely true.  Anyone who has to support the code behind you will 'care.  Tech debt is real, and sloppy code that just works, over time, tends to create more hassles than the time they save just pushing ""working"" code out the window.  I totally agree, the client doesn't care how the sausage is made, but the other cooks will care if the recipe's a mess and takes too much of their time to modify or update.   Again this is NOT to detract from your point to the viewers (don't worry so much about your code you don't do it or release it, ultimately no one will care about it), I just don't want to lose sight of the folks that actually will (even if your a distant memory 😊)."

I believe that badly named variables/functions/classes cause significant frustration when working in a team. If you work on a project single-handedly then sure, you're right but not giving a thought to how you name stuff, breaking conventions and staying inconsistent is a major pain point on projects with more contributors."
@malcolmjacquard4689,"Great video. You nailed it. :)

And for anyone who is more interested in systems administration, providing a cloud or similar: It's almost the same. 

So whenever I meet an apprentice or someone who just entered the business, the first thing I tell them: Your most important ability is to get along with waiting even if customers are pushing you to get things done fast. e.g. You will have to wait for installations to finish, systems will reboot slowly before you can continue and don't you do something else because when you start multi-tasking you will make mistakes. So: Don't even try to be fast, don't even try to be perfect, make sure that the tasks you do actually result in a system state that does what it is supposed to do. Then if you mastered the ability to wait without doing some other task, you need to learn to do this when the customer is pushing you to get things done fast. Rule of thumb: There are no fast solutions. There are only things that work and those that don't and the time it takes to get them done is the time they will have taken. More often then not a problem is simply solved by doing nothing for ten minutes. And the solutions that work and are done fast often are the ones that will result in problems that you just don't see when you implement them. So stick to solving the problem or implementing just the next feature before turning towards the one after that and take the time that is necessary so that it is done properly. And if you mastered this you get to the hardest part: Nobody will recognized that you did a proper job because they do not understand what the actual job is. In systems anything that anyone will see is when things do not work as the user expects them to. So nobody will see that you did a great job. Because doing a great job means that the systems will run as the user expects. And even when users have caused a problem, they will point the finger at the system or even at you. But if you do a decent job you'll have a decent income and more than enough time to make projects you'd like to invest time and noone will care about how many hours you actually have to invest to get your job done."

@arbitervildred8999,"8. Don't stay stuck in one language/framewok ""because that's the only thing you currently know""
set yourself new challenges, new objectives, new tools. then you can try to learn and achieve those


to be fair when you code long enough (and don't copy paste, but instead search and learn how to do it so you can still code it yourself) you learn it, I used to code in pygame for about 2 years and now it's burnt into my brain I hardly find myself searching something up out of 2000 lines code span, and now been doing GD Script and C# for almost 4 years, once again I hardly find myself going online, heck even if I need to look something up, i just control + click on the objects and it goes to the class definitions, there i find properties, methods, callbacks, everything i need

@mas6830,"The Importance of Not Knowing It All
🧠
Understanding that mastery does not require memorization of every detail is crucial.
 
🔍
Google searches are common even among experienced developers; they signify an ability to find solutions.
 
📚
Emphasizing knowledge acquisition over rote memory leads to improved problem-solving skills.
Learning to Code Effectively
🔄
Transitioning from consuming tutorials to creating your own projects is essential for real learning.
 
⏰
A productive rule is to spend four times as much time building as you do watching tutorials.
 
🏗
Building real projects—even imperfect ones—enhances skills far more than passive consumption.
Embracing Imperfection in Development
🔥
Perfectionism can be paralyzing; even seasoned developers produce imperfect code.
 
👷‍♂
Focusing on completing projects leads to faster improvement and confidence in one's abilities.
 
✔
Finished products, even if untidy, provide more learning opportunities than perfect, unused code.
Problem-Solving as a Core Skill
🕵
Understanding that coding is fundamentally about solving problems, not just syntax, is critical.
 
🧩
Debugging is a vital part of development and should be seen as an opportunity rather than a failure.
 
❓
Continuously asking questions and breaking tasks into smaller parts enhances development efficiency.
Managing Burnout and Maintaining Balance
⚠
Burnout is a significant risk in programming; managing energy is crucial for sustained productivity.

@NassiLove,"I followed tutorials when I did my first few projects, but during school we were taught one thing one at a time, and then told to make something from what we learnt

My first program was like. Nestled if else nightmare cus it was the only thing we learnt, but while doing so I realized the limitations, and as I play tested I kept finding more stuff I wanted to fix

Then next time we learnt for and while loops, which I immediately found a way to use to solve a lot of the if else issues.

Then we learnt about methods, etc. Etc. And I just kinda built from that.

Every time I learnt something new. I used it. I played with it. I spent time understanding what it did and stretching it to it's limits.

When I learnt something new, I looked to see if I could use it to fix issues I had before. Then I did it again. And again.

I'm not a good coder, but I understand my code well, and I know what every single thing I write down is supposed to do, and if I don't, I study it.

People don't always have time for this, but it's insanely helpful.

I was doing my first game jam a month ago, and I followed a tutorial for a character creator.

I hadn't coded anything for a year, so I forgot how to even do anything in unity. How do I make code... Connect to the objects? That's how much I forgot.

But the moment I finished the tutorial I started doing my own thing, and it was working! It was working really well, and when it broke, I could accurately guess why.

When I couldn't find tutorials for what I needed? I followed one that was similar, learnt something new that I could use in other places, but also I could discern what I needed for my plan to work, and what I didn't really need.

I only write and/or delete lines when I know what it does, that way I don't explode everything lmao

We all have stupid issues too of, programming does that to you. If you haven't had a silly mistake during programming that cost you what felt like 50 years off your life, have you ever done programming?

I once got stuck for a month due to forgetting to reset the velocity on my character, which was a really silly mistake, but it happens!

Good tip: all the bugs come out when you try recording your progress. Even after testing out everything before and it working fine, the moment you try showing it to others it starts falling apart, trust. Good way to find new bugs fr

On a serious note, what I like to do when testing out where a bug is happening (usually if I suspect a variable is at fault or if I can't locate the exact location) use debug.log/console.writeline/your equiv!

It helps a lot because not only can you make the program tell you what the values of the variables are (if you suspect there's an issue with one, especially if a lot of variables are used in one line so you can't tell which one... Me doing undo redo function with 12 variables to save... I hate you undo redo...)
But if you can't locate the issue, you can put down some ""marks"" to see which one fires off before things explode. If one doesn't fire before the game breaks, then the issue must be happening between the last that worked and the one that didn't.

Helps on places where it breaks later in the code but you can't tell because the computer processes it so quickly so it feels like it breaks 100 lines earlier. Happened to me before. Crashes a whole 150 lines before the actual issue, spent 30 minutes looking there only to realize it came later.

Anyway, I'm not very experienced, I programmed like. Four things. One was my 12 nestled if else statements hell (yes. I counted there was 12. It was horrifying truly), two was my second attempt using for and while loops so the program loops until you answer something valid, third was programming the game ""Meyer"" using the console, I used a lot of methods for that one, and the AI was really good at the game too :3, fourth was my finals project where I programmed a pomodoro timer with a cat, where if you touched it while you're supposed to be studying it would hiss at you and lower affection, but on break time you could pet it for some affection, but it didn't demand your time so you could do other things on break.

And then my game jam game like. A month ago :3 which was pretty big compared to my other stuff. It was ""just a dress up"" but istg undo redo? Hatred. More stuff was annoying but those two are my mortal enemy.

But it helped!! You don't even have to learn one thing at a time like they do in school. That was just an example of how I started out, but if you learn a new thing in a tutorial, think about where else you could use it!

I learnt grids for a pop up menu that would show all the available options, but then I realized. Hey. I could use these to make my life easier someplace else.

Its pretty self explanatory, but maybe someone will find it helpful. Don't just copy paste, look at what the code does, and see if you could use it somewhere else.

When I learnt for and while loops I didn't use it how they taught us in the example. I used it for dialogue! Until you gave a valid response, it would loop the question.

Is there a better way to do it? Maybe. Was it better than what I had previously? Absolutely.

And that's what matters. Is the code better than before? Yes? Good! You're improving!
And hey you found a cool way to use it, that's epic! Next time you learn something, maybe you can improve it even more!

You don't need a big project to ""start writing"" you can start with something super tiny and simple. You can start following a tutorial and building on that. It can be the smallest ever game, but its something you made. It exists. It runs. If it doesn't? Fix it! Now you learnt what went wrong!

My first two projects is literally just a bunch of text in the console lmao, and so was my third, but it was a lot more complex than the first two."

@vadiks20032,"the problem for me is:
i wake up, feel sleepy ""I'll first keep reading the book, then i'll go program""
then i am not sleepy nymore but, ""this chapter is inteerting, i can do a bit later""
then i shower and say ""ill go back and program""
i shower, thinking on what i could work on, what i want to do
i  get to pc, forcefully open my existing project, i look at it , lose any idea on what to do  i minimize window, chat with people, bobom its night.
well, its night so i cant program, i need sleep
so i go sleep

i dislike solving problems. i have a problem that i want to make map for obejcts for my game, but it means i hve to change my array of objects, i have to somehow make functions that add and remove obejcts, i have t ofigure out a way to search for obejcts, i have to make it so that when player passes certain point, it deletes specific objects and makes new specific objects, and my first thoughan t is adding if(position.x >) in update loop, which isnt good because it will keep doing something that i want to do once, every frame. so i think of mking boolean, boom ,its kinda stupid if i want to mke a ton of such gates, so i think of idea of making a system that maps specific collider with specific function - so i have to make so that each trigger collier can have a lambda function thats called on collission, but boom my friend says its too complciated and i shouldnt overthink so hard, then he comes up with some simplified solutuion that i didnt think of, but boom, i work with it more and realize that his solution isnt very comfortable to keep wokrking with... and then i think that i have to have a code that deletes and creates objects depending on distance for performance and because its design of my game that i want to happen"

I dont mean understanding like reading, but understanding like feeling the concept.
Its not about learning to program, its about applying.
Applying knowledge or ideas is how you properly use anything in life tbh.
And what people dont understand nowadays is, there are categories for coding.
Debugging. Creation. Optimisation. Injection. Disection. Each have their own fields. But also there are skills that grow beyond. Stitching. Compatibility. Expandability.
If you want to code, focus on one first. If you wanna be good at debugging, you focus on debugging. You can combine this with creation, with stitching, etc. But mainly to focus on the primary idea you target.

Also.
For the love of god.
Dont.
Ever.
Nest.
More than 4 If statements.
Please.

Also I care if your code is fancy if I have to look at it.
If you make a game, make it readable, expandable and understand how it works.
Rushing that shit gives results like LoL longterm or Minecraft.

@balintharangozo4106,"It’s because of your sixth rule that there’s so much lousy code on github.
It’s because of your sixth rule that project has to be rewritten — work that doesn’t take code quality into account.
The sixth rule is the rule of quick payment and quick loss of your client.

If, a year after writing code in the spirit of the sixth rule, you’re asked to modify it, you won’t even know where to begin.

If you do meticulous work and your code is of high quality, that should matter to you personally.
And indeed, you’re right that no one looks at the quality of your code.
But even so, the code still has to be clean, understandable, reusable, maintainable, and usable by others.

What should really be shared with beginner programmers is that the fundamental key to carrying out a good project is planning, thinking ahead, outlining the problems, and searching for solutions — all before writing a single line of code.

They need to immerse themselves in the project they want to build, but first they must understand it, gain a clear overview, and then plan. Only after that, once a proper plan is in place, should coding begin — and an essential part of coding is testing.

This is how you can create code that is completed quickly, because it isn’t full of unnecessary dead ends; code that is reusable and can be extended at any time, because the tests will show when a new development has had a negative impact on an earlier feature.

These are the things that should be talked about."

One of the very first things one of my professors told me was “You do not need to know everything but you need to learn how to find any knowledge that you will need in the future” (that was before the internet even existed, so Googling wasn’t a thing and finding knowledge was a bit more tricky, but the idea is still valid up until today). In short, googling concepts is fine, copying stuff from Stackoverflow is a bad idea. And never stop improving"
@ofmouseandman1316,"I'm in the same place than you carreerwize I don't fully agree with #6: 2 people care about your code: Coworkers and Future You. But I agree... over clever is bad.

@AlecVoid,"I am a dev for 30 years now and you took the words right out of my mouth.

A couple additions: you need to avoid burnout, but you need to keep a routine as well: coding once a week is not enough, you need frequent repetition as well. Second, every problem you encounter has a solution, there are bugs, sure, but more likely: it's your code. Keep digging! Third: I like looking at my own, nicely written code, the few bits and pieces of it."

@Minh-oq5ex,"I just want coding. I’m interested in AR/VR development for iOS apps, like Vision Pro. I’ve been in iOS developer for 6–7 years, but many companies are looking for leaders or technical leads — people who spend more time in meetings, reviewing code, and handling CI/CD. That’s not what I want. The problem is that companies usually hire younger people for junior or mid-level, while seniors is for leader position. I’d like to stay at the mid-level, but I cannot since I joined IT later in life. I feel stuck now."

@CrimeGaming1337,"About the plumbing.. You actually want a plumber who works cleanly, at least I assume. Whenever there is an issue that needs to be fixed.. you don't want that to get messy xD. Same for coding, if your structure is shit, it will be hard to make changes. But you shouldn't focus on perfection that much in the beginning."
@ramkumarrealm,"You don't need to know everything. Real developers don't memorize every detail; they know how to find answers and use patterns.

It's okay to Google basic things often—it’s part of being a good developer and learning how to learn.

Learning coding is like learning a language: watching tutorials isn’t enough; you have to actually write code to become fluent.

Spend at least four times as much building and coding on your own as you do consuming tutorials to truly learn.

Perfection is a trap. Do not obsess over writing perfect or elegant code before you ship.

Done is better than perfect. Shipping code that works teaches more than perfect code that never finishes.

You will never feel ready. Start anyway—even if scared or uncertain, action builds confidence and opens doors.

The real skill is problem solving, not just writing code. Learn to break down problems and debug effectively.

Nobody cares about how clever your code is—they care about what it does and if it solves the problem.

Burnout is real. Protect your energy by taking breaks, setting boundaries, and caring for your mental health.

Additional expanded practical insights based on these:

Don’t feel bad if you need to look things up constantly—even advanced devs do it regularly.

Shift your mindset from passive learning to active creating as early and often as possible.

Get comfortable with making mistakes and breaking things; this is where real learning happens.

Avoid overthinking variable names or tiny details early on; focus on functionality first.

Code reviews and feedback help improve code over time—embrace iterative improvement.

Confidence builds from doing real projects, freelancing, or contributing to open source—even if imperfect.

Debugging is a core part of development; see bugs as puzzles, not failures.

Prioritize writing code that solves the user’s needs above “cleanliness” or “best practices” at first.

Set sustainable work habits—coding productivity is about pace you can maintain long term.

Celebrate progress, no matter how small; every step forward matters in the learning journey."
@askaaaaaaaaaaa-y8r,Thank you
@CrimeGaming1337,"Perfection is a myth, the more I try to solve problems and actually implement the solutions, the more I notice that imperfections can't be avoided.

@meggrobi,"The best way to start is have a problem you need to solve. Lay out a design which is an overview, not micro detail, of what the output and input needs to be. You then have a plan, so you have bite size chucks to solve.

Don't expect what you are doing today to last, plan for the change and  dabble with the ""new kid on the block"".

@ryanmonti4903,"I started programming in the early 1980's as a teenager. No Internet, no YouTube, just manuals, magazines and the TI-99 Hamilton Ontario user group.
I'm 59 now and retired to Southeast Asian 3 years ago.

Everything you said is true, always expect your code to have issues, make small manageable changes.

The programming tools are light years ahead of where they were in the 1980's, I had had Assembly Language programs that would simply freeze, no error logs or nothing, just La La Land."

@nadiaallahbakhsh-ve4zc,"Thank you so much sir. 
Great conversation. I hope this will help me a lot. In sha Allah"
@jTheN77,"I find that if I start with the simplest thing and go from there, I work it out. When first playing with C, VBA, assembler, Python, Docker - ""Hello World"" showed that my software was installed properly, the configuration (if any) was good, and then I could start building up the little pieces that add up to a big piece.

Making sure the little piece works before going on. Writing 100 lines and having the compiler/interpreter crash means something's wrong somewhere. But where? If it isn't obvious with a quick review, then start over, going one step at a time, or save a copy and then start slicing out modular code. If you don't have modular code, even if the ""modules"" are noting but indented lines in one page of code, the reason it is bombing either has to be easy or you will waste time trying to chase the crazy squirrel that is having fun with your efforts. 

Writing modular code, short code, code with full names for variables, procedures and constants will save a LOT of time. If not now, then in the future. Trying to decipher: 

IF dm2 <> gth and ujsu < .982928 then  
   CALL dnkysu 
  if A1 <> B3 then
    z1++
  end if
 call SSUUSJW!!
S1(x1, hysh22)
D2(z, hsuj)
. . . . and on and on
END IF

Two busy weeks, moths, or years later and running through a lot of vague code will confuse you and make you rework the logic over. Not bad for simple logic, but when its a lot of code you do not need to be deciphering what ""R1, R2, C2, d2, e, e1, fg etc"" means.

Not when something like ""videoRow1"" or ""targetSheet.cell(headerRow, SalesColumn)"" etc. tells you what (or almost what) you were thinking at a glance.

I have a C program with I do not know how many headers and lines of code from 2010. I did what I wanted with it and stopped. I wrote the variables, constants, procedures and names in ""ENGLISH"" and I can read it and understand it today.

Someone who has never programmed the concept will not get this, but here literally is what simple ""English"" coding does:

/***************************************************************
// check 8 surrounding squares for fuel/cost
// and consider any unit to block

// should have used player not p and unit not u

int Immediate_Exit_Square (int p, int u, int x, int y)
{
  int d, cx, cy, ux, uy, openspaces;
  int PlayerAt, UnitAt;
  int Current_Fuel, FuelUse, Blocked;

  ux = Unit[p][u].X;
  uy = Unit[p][u].Y;
  Current_Fuel = Unit[p][u].Fuel;
//  sprintf (OutText, ""Fuel Start %d and cost %d from  %d %d to go %d %d"",  fuel, Movement_Cost (ux, uy, x, y),;  LogFile (OutText);

  Current_Fuel = Current_Fuel - Movement_Cost (ux, uy, x, y);
. . . [snip not the full code]

With constants like these, I can READ the code without puzzling over vague numeric states . . .

#define GAME_OPEN          1000
#define GAME_SAVE          1001
#define SCENARIO_OPEN      1002
#define FILE_CLOSE         1010
#define FILE_EXIT          1011
#define FILE_NEW_GAME      1012

That is just a few of the constants. Well named and organized constants will really, really help keep the logic flow obvious."
@aayushgour3303,I just started learning coding and I think after your video I am gonna save a lot of time as I was planning to watch long tutorials again and again instead of trying to build something i think before i start watching another tutorial i am gonna go ahead and try to do a project first. thanks for the helpful advice :)

I am okay to learn and okay to take feedback, but i have spent years loving coding , learning and i did my masters to be in a field i love the most a developer and someone telling ur not good at the one thing u know in life was hard to digest. All those hours and sleepless nights i have spent to deliver a clean and beautiful code turned out to be a pain. He also told me you have a masters degree and you need to know so much. These words were told to me after i came back from a break due to anxiety. And it was hard to take. But i didnt give up and wont.

I started down this path late in life at the age of 38 in 2018 and I struggled with every one of the points you made in this video and still struggle with a few of them. This was a good reminder and I think learning how to learn and solving problems under stressful situations is really what it’s all about. Learn how to read the logs, learn what the errors are telling you. There have been countless times that I’ve gone down a completely wrong path looking for a solution because I skim read the error or misinterpreted it. 

Good stuff here."

For example, how to find specific obj in stack."

@BustaHymen,"Greatest pep video ever, this applies to so many things in life! Thanks for a great video :)

One thing I don't fully agree with though, is #6. There are tons of cases where someone coded something, then left the company and the client wanted features added or the like. Then the person tasked to do the job can find it a nightmare, if the code isn't ""by the book"" or at least somewhat structured (Veronica Explains has a video about this very subject, if memory serves).

Same with the plumber, the first one might not care how he installs the pipes, but the second one who comes to fix a problem does."

@NPC-vg8kx,"My biggest lesson in IT is that people need to communicate. Stop trying to solve everything on your own and ask for help from colleagues when you find yourself stuck.
Especially when I moved on to a more leadership role I observed how people were working on islands. Don't work on your island, build a supportive community. Have a question? Ask it. Stop spending 3 hours going through documentation. Someone on Teams knows the answer and can tell you it in 5 seconds.

Communication is actually the reason I became a team lead. My programming is not as good as some of my team members, but at least I can talk to business and organise the group. But now I am in charge of a team cause I am simply better at communicating."

@incarnateTheGreat,"All fair points. I will say this: the only people who care about your code are the other developers who might/will work with it in the future. You should aim to write elegant, well-performing code all the time. Yes, there are some exceptions because either business rules or BE services aren't easy to work with, but ultimately you write code well not just for performance but so others can understand it when debugging or enhancing it."

@craft2d274,"The biggest problem I have is modeling basic things.
I know graphics usually come last, but you still need some basic models in order to implement features.

My biggest and best project so far is called TasteTycoon. I worked on it for about two weeks, building a tiny McDonald’s with customers, an item system (without an inventory system), and ingredients like cutting cheese to make a burger, cheeseburger, or hotdog.

But when I finished that part, I started thinking about what to add next — and everything new would require more models: a microwave, fryer, fries, paper bags… And for that, I’d need to open Blender again. Every time I reach this point, the project usually comes to an end."

@kxmode,"1. *You don't need to know everything* - Real developers don't have every function memorized. It's about patterns, problem-solving, and finding answers (Googling is normal).

2. *Learn how to learn* - Watching tutorials isn't enough—you learn by building. Rule of thumb: for every 1 hour watching, spend 4 hours coding.

3. *Perfection is a trap* - No code is flawless; even senior devs break things. Shipping ""ugly but working"" code teaches more than chasing perfection.

4. *You'll never feel ready—start anyway.* Confidence comes from doing, not waiting. Say yes, even if you feel scared or unprepared.

5. *The real skill is problem-solving.* Coding is less about syntax, more about breaking problems into chunks. Debugging isn't failure—it's the job.

6. *Nobody cares about your code; they care about results.* Clients/users care about outcomes, not elegant code. Value > vanity.

7. *Burnout is real—protect your energy.* Grinding nonstop doesn't make you better. Sustainability matters: take breaks, sleep, recharge."

@marksawesomeadventures,"I Liked this Video a lot, the reason I Clicked on this Video was, I decided I was going to test out the new ChatGPT with it's Coding Capabilities. I tried studying Programming before I gave up, but I figured if ChatGPT could do most of the Work maybe I would try again. After giving up a long time ago, I talked to a lot of Programmers, and more than one told me exactly what you just said. They said the best way to Learn how to Code is to Dream up an idea of what you want to do, then figure out how to do it. I decided I wanted to create an Avatar, that would be a Front End to ChatGPT, it would reside on my Computer, but Pipe the I/O to ChatGPT. It would use Morphing to make a .jpg Image Talk. using TTS. I typed what I wanted into ChatGPT and it cranked out the Code and told me how to set it up, and now I am Lost. I just started taking it line by line and trying to figure out what each thing means. I just learned what npm does. Now I have to figure out what happens when I RUN npm, then the next step. But that's why i clicked on this Video. 
I feel like this Video was inspiring. Thanks. 😁"

Thank you so much for this video, it solves every problem I have, henceforth I will begin to learn coding differently with a renewed zeal and approach. Thanks a million times and over."
@Xoloes,"Guys from my perspective burnout is like calling yourself a deadman
if you empty yourself for a project could've just called it off and go home
have the breaks whenever i had a thought like ""Should i leave it and come later?""
i alot of time had myself sitting on a computer for 17 hours straight for debugging some problems and i didn't leave it because ""if i exit now i may not be as efficient"" 
TOTAL NONSENSE
if you think you should go list out the bugs on a note and come back to it later!
got a way to fix the bug ""i will just stay here to finish this one and go""
write what you thought on a NOTE AND GOO
a burnout doesn't fix overnight 
It stays untill you decide to take it off
once you took it off you better stay without it

@74Gee,"I've been a programmer for 42 years and I was skeptical when I read the title but I couldn't agree more. You really hit the nail on the head.
I have one more to add:

The language is not important, when you learn to program in one language, you've almost learned all of them - every language from javascript to assembly are essentially the same - they all follow the same logic - only the syntax changes. It's like learning to count to 10 and then finding counting to 100 much easier. So when ever you have an opportunity to use a language designed for a problem, try that for at least a couple of hours. You'll become much more efficient with more languages!"

Our role goes beyond simply making the code functional; it is essential to ensure that the code is efficient, maintainable, and well-structured.
Clean code leads to better collaboration, easier debugging, and long-term project success."
@HankRhule,Really what can you love more really today what's really new to us that excited us more than becoming a professional programmer most of our time isn't making love once creating the magic is the account to accomplish come on now let's be honest okay tell us early or hope we're even ready now to explain what I mean this is really my 💬💭 thought. The love of anyone's life isn't the quickest thought 💭🤔 just come up with it. If someone through the years told me that I could create my life through this I too would of kept trying with out a pause. Okay can get tired yes and feel burnt out but explained it well programmer with a voice tone convincing me and maybe even others that it's even possible.

@QueirozVini,"10 years developer here as well. All tips are accurate, apart from the ""nobody cares about your code"".
Most CEOs and other non-technical employees aren't knowledgeable enough about software engineering to know what ""intrinsic quality"" is. Ok, the final user doesn't care, and they shouldn't. But the person who is paying you so you handle them the complete and working SYSTEM (instead of offering them a SaaS), should definitely care about code quality. If they did know that code quality means a software that is robust and easy to extend and maintain - which translates directly in their words to ""reduced costs"" - then I assure you they would in fact care about your code.

Following your analogy, if I hire a plumber and instead of screwing a pipe to one another they connect one pipe to another using epoxy resin, then I would be mad as hell!
I (or the next plumber) would have to break everything to give maintenance again later on, even if it was just one pipe that was problematic.

I hope this video reaches the newer developers as well, they will greatly benefit from these tips!"

@TheEvilVir,"""Nobody cares about your code"" - this is kind of attitude that JavaScript developers have and reason why JavaScript ecosystem is a shithole. The fact that your client doesn't care about your code is not an excuse to write shitty mess. You should care about your code, and if your boss doesn't then it's a shitty boss and you work in wrong place altogether. Sure that ""perfection is a trap"" and ""you'll never feel ready"", these are true. You will never reach perfection but you must try to, otherwise you will get yourself into trouble if that project you don't care about will be longer than one month."

@pldcanfly,"That advice on burnout is curcial. It gave me gray hairs in my 20ties, a dark time with bad thoughts, switching jobs,  moving country and 3000 Euros worth of therapy to learn to have boundaries and not freak out. I still am dealing with the consequences of that time in my life and prolly will forever. Now I am paid for x amount of hours in a week. If I should work more, I need to be paid more. Sounds anti-grind minded, but I'd rather keep my mental health intact then to burn out on something that will not get me much further either. It's hard, because a lot of development is the constant flip between ""I am a genius god!"" to ""Why did I ever touch a keyboard, and how am I even able to get dressed in the morning?"" But keep your sanity, it is not worth it to ruin yourself for the rest of your life just for a random dude giving you a pat on the back and a free pizza on friday."

@ArdaKaraduman,"about naming things ... when you first start a project, you usually dont have the full scope of what you are doing. so just come up with a name that feels right at that point. dont spend too much time. when you are near completion, you have better understand of the scope, and what a variable is doing, so rename things that doesnt make sense anymore. most IDEs have features to easily rename things."

@mehranqadri,"I am in your shoes by my own, learned all of these from my experience. Thanks for making video for the younger devs."
@mersi-d,"I watched this video and agreed with a lot of what was said, especially the idea that we don’t need to know *everything*. But I think there’s something that should’ve been clarified.

Yes, we don’t need to know ""everything"" , but that doesn’t mean we should settle for surface-level understanding. I personally want to learn everything ""useful""— not to brag about it, but to actually fill the gaps and build a solid foundation. I’ve learned this the hard way: skipping things too quickly creates gaps that slow you down later.

So what I want to say is — you should’ve pronounced it this way:  
“Don’t try to learn everything at once.”
Not:  
“You don’t have to know everything.”

There’s a big difference. One is about pace, the other sounds like permission to skip. And for some of us, skipping is not an option — we’re in it for mastery."

Much appreciated.   Similarly, in Software Engineer white-boarding interviews, don't feel bad if you can't develop a fantastic algorithm pronto; most hiring managers really only care to see your ""thinking process"" and ""problem solving process"".  On the job, you normally will have far more time to refactor and improve the code properly."
@jeffweir,Well done. All points are well thought out and accurate. The last one maybe should have been first. When you're stuck it's often best to just walk away. Easier said than done but when you wake up in the night with a solution it's so gratifying ;-)

@1319matt-e4n,"I'm the only dev in my office without a degree
Company is paying for my BS in CS
how did I get here?
my personal rules: 
1. Get rid of all social media
2. Math is hard...Khan academy
3. Time management becomes a genuine skill. 
Apple watch allows for daily reminders (reminders on phone causes you to reach for your phone too much)
Start every day with a written list (created the day before) (yes written)
4. Manage your hours: I bought a ""Gym boss"" timer, set it to 15 minutes.
This keeps me focused on the task at hand. seems excentric.... but it works.
5. Drink water all day and get 10K steps daily  (have a walking pad to achieve this)

Final fact: Too many students nowadays are overusing Ai to complete thier assignments vice learning to code.
This narritive that coders are going to be fully replaced is false. Ai is nothing but a tool to be leveraged.
So, learn to leverage it. Ai will have its impact... but it won't replace us."

+ code is disposable, just because you invested in it doesn't mean you should keep it! 
+ if you make an assumption about a feature, prove it. The customer rarely knows exactly what they want so don't just take their (or your) word for it. The earlier you prove it the better. Sometimes its much quicker and easier to do this on paper than in code
+ developers work better in a team, you challenge and learn from each other as you work. The code you produce is always better. Conversely one developer working solo is dangerous - if there is no-one to challenge you, how do you know you're doing it wrong?
+ good tests are worth the time it takes to write them and write the test first. That way you can prove your code works and that you only write testable code

Honestly these help so much. I finished college as a computer engineer and barely know how to code right now because I've been so scared to even try it.
(My decisions at college were kind of questionable which lead me to this point). Now I have 4 years of ""work experience"" as an Sys Admin because I never had the courage to try to get into a dev job because I was so scared of messing up and coding. I developed a huge impostor syndrome and started tricking myself into believing that I didn't actually like to code...
Now I'm full of regret but also wanting to retake my path and try to land my very first developer job while I plan into getting to a masters program.
It's all so true, guys. Don't let your fears take it away from you as I let it happen to me. Don't let fear and insecurities take away something so rewarding and enlighting as coding. I used to love it and started hating it for stupid reasons and decisions.

Again, thank you because I now see that I was too afraid and I didn't exercise well my problem solving skills... I know what I was missing and view it differently and now I'm sure I can at least give it another try."

Even though I'm miles ahead of most of my colleagues - sometimes some panic still fights me. Especially nowadays when technologies and frameworks are appearing and become out of date faster than you become expert with them. The good old days of ""becoming really good in 1-2-3 key languages / libs / approaches"" are long gone. It's a continuous race.
And yeah - I still google. And youtube, and learn. And read docs. Talk to colleagues. And still trying to catch up. Non stop. IT is the industry where you're never perfect to the job.

@vintz-dev,"Thank you so much. As a frontend developer with four years of experience, I found myself deeply resonating with many parts of your message. Each piece of advice felt like a gem, and I truly appreciate the wisdom you shared.

Since my early days as a junior developer, I’ve been writing blog posts to reflect and share what I learn. Your video was incredibly inspiring, and I’d love to help share its message with developers here in Korea by translating it (with the help of AI) and posting it on my blog.

I’m not very fluent in English, but I did my best to make sure the translated content stays true to your original message. Would it be okay if I write a blog post including the proper credit and a link to your video? I would be truly grateful for your permission."

@Trae4k,"Huge caveat to #6 is you are writing that nice code for the next dev. Focus on making it work, but it is still important to think about the maintainability. How easy can I add a feature to this or change the way that it works. You can't just be the person who gets it done as fast as possible leaving an absolute nightmare in your wake. Find the balance."
@gamefax5741,"That quality component can really hurt later devs down the road. I suppose the dev implementing later doesn't matter as the two likely never meet.  I have had to deal with some very sloppy implementations written by weekend warrior coders.  I learned some of the red flags as very novice coders typically say/do similar things.  If you ask about organization, they'll tell you to just read the code and understand it (No planned organization).  I recall opening up A SQL report and immediately recognizing unsafe grouping which meant the results were not deterministic.   Other red flags are no use of custom functions or classes, all variables are global, and magic numbers everywhere.  I have seen these problems at small companies to large international companies."

Hearing this is exactly what I needed. I’ve been grinding my books with every second of free time that I have. Making myself feel terrible for not understanding what I’m reading or knowing the basic starts of some of my lab question. Now I realize that I’m possibly far past the point of burnout. 
I’m just glad to know it’s not just a me thing"
@snarfblat2k,"I've been a developer for thirty years.  I'm self educated, so no degree.  That means as I age out, nobody wants to hire me even though I know more than probably anybody else on their staff.  Furthermore, AI is becoming a big problem... it is eventually going to replace all of us, so I recommend NOT becoming a developer.  Find a job that can't be replaced by AI... like a plumber or electrician. Companies are also starting to want people back on-site and I flat REFUSE to EVER go on-site again.  Covid provided it's unnecessary.  When I can't get developer work anymore, I will sell everything I own minus my RV and just live on public land and get a job at Tractor Supply or something."
@ScarlettTheViewer,7:29 Uh oh! (Lower right corner)
@InuGoliath91,I wish someone told me these earlier!
@Parciwal_Gaming,"Ok so maybe it's because I first learned in school but like, this all seems very obvious to me. Especially the problem solving part. Like: you are given a task, you are given a set of commands, get it to work and done. If it breaks, fix it. If you forget something, add it etc. Not needing to know everything also seems like a given. Every language has hundereds or thousands of libraries and commands that do all kinds of stuff which you don't need to know until you need it. Just make sure you know how to find the stuff you need. The ""you'll never feel ready"" is something I learned myself, just by trying out. Any good company will be more concerned with your motivation to work than your current skill lever, because everything can be taught, except motivation."
@dassrull,"My god, man, you just pulled me out of a ditch!"
@lianite-pe9np,"Been a software engineer for 20 years now, and the single greatest skill I ever developed was done very early in my journey. And that skill is the ability to step through my code, or anyone else's code, manually. Look at the inputs to a function, write them down, and assign values to them. Then walk through line by line and write down how those variables change until you reach the end. Verify that it's doing what you think it's doing. Repeat with different types and values for the inputs and ensure proper output is coming out the other side. I was super slow at this in the beginning, but it really helped me understand code at a more intimate level. I got so fast at this that I do it lie second nature, and I spend so much less time debugging and more time writing code that works. Highly recommend to everyone to get better at walking through code, not just with ""happy path"" variables (what you think they should be), but throw in weird ones to. If a variable is supposed to be an integer, what happens if a null gets passed in? Or an empty object? It really helps you add in safe-guards to your code to prevent bugs."

@xdisruptor6630,"Some of these tips are ok-ish if you plan on being a mid-level coder - but not a real engineer (especially if you need to take into account security and scalability in the mix). If you're aiming to be a really senior engineer in FAANG you're gonna need much more than this stuff because this stuff only ""gets you started"". Software engineering is much more complex as you move higher and higher in complexity while ensuring maintainability. Take this stuff with a grain of salt."

@loganboi962,i wont lie a big battle ive had to deal with is finding something i want to do or am patinate about. ive always loved games and think deving is very cool/ rewarding but making a big leap into a profession isnt talked about enough its alot to consider. i dont care about money but i dont wanna struggle and i sure as heck dont wanna hate my job again as is a common feeling im sure. but when i dev i feel engaged and interested . im just at the point of over worrying ig lol big choices to be had not alot of time isnt that life
@Norritt42,Agree with all with the exception of clean code. Write good modules which are seperate from rest of code. Large project requires clean code and clean architecture!
@libyan_oasy,"you'll never feel ready (or confident enough) , start anyway.

first of all , im not a programmer. i always wanted to start learning java (self-learning) for personal use , hopefully maybe starting an app with it but i keep coming across alot of people saying that java is lame or dead language soo i got scared that ill waste my time learning it , then someone pop up says that java is one of the most important ones to learn , getting me all confused , no other language interests me as much as java (yet) but the feeling still there, but after i watched this video , honestly , i said to my self , @#$% it , ill learn java and whatever happens happen."

@bonamin,"I always liked technology, always liked computers, so quite naturally I also like programming. 
I started a couple of years ago tinkering with some arduinos for the ""joke"" of it. But then out of that, I found a guy (now friend and partner) with a similar passion (but for mechanical engineering), and now we are 1 step away from shipping a product that is mechanical yet requires a bespoke control board that I am programming.  

I had to go through what this guy here describes in the video, and I can Honestly tell you, he is absolutely 100% right. 
For example, at first I was taking an awful lot of time to make my C code look beautiful. But really, who cares ? 
Does your device work ? Is it doing what it's supposed to do ? The client will never, ever see the code. 
Just make it, test it, fix it, ship it. (then update it to fix it again since you definitely missed something HAHAHAH)

Honestly, really good advice, really good video."

@shelanem,"Great stuff. One point of disagreement. As a team lead, I do care about the code that my team produces. Why? Because we all have to touch it and work within it. It has to work together for the whole product and I might have to go into the code. It should be readable and use best practices. I don't like to hear, why do I need to abstract that code into a service class, it works. It may work with too much complexity, but that's not the code I want to see."
@MAVrikrrr,"No one cares about your code, but you have to care. It'll hit you the harder the messier it is, whenever you have to change your code."
@TheCodeCreator,"Ok. I'm old. I've been a developer for more than 32 years now. I learned Pascal and QBasic. I developed in Fortran, DBase, Clipper, C, Visual Basic, Java, Javascript, C#. I don't remember anything from the first ones, believe me. - Anyway, not a problem, they are not needed anymore these days but using them gave me the experience I have today.
""Perfection is a trap""? It is! You can resume all of this to constant Refactoring, right? That's what a developer should be doing almost endlessly. That's how a good piece of software becomes robust, and even though, it is never complete. Take lots of small breaks, and in those breaks, do not think about coding, not even computers. When you got stuck on a problem, error, etc., remember a good night sleep is very good for troubleshooting first thing in the morning."

Don't use AI to give you answers! Instead, use your prompt to generate more questions.

If you do this, you'll get a much broader understanding of whatever's the topic which will stick more likely to the Brain. And this could make you skip 1 or more iterations of an idea without even doing it in the first place."

@TastySites,"I bump all of them, battery especially - enjoy life, you will do in one hour what you would struggle to do in 10 if you are exhausted

But the biggest one is missing
Sit fucking comfortable

Find a place on the floor, put a thick joga mat under your ass, kinda half sit so your legs and torso have somewhat 90 angle 
Find a comfortable laptop desk that you can place on you so when you type your elbows are also somewhat at 90 angle 

And put a screen at the level of your eyes so you feel comfortable 

For me the best setup is Mac and iPad o solid goose neck stand plus screen mirror - super easy setup

Do breaks each fucking 50 minutes for 10 minutes no matter what (if you skip it anyway, go for a walk after 100)

@Sakata7Gintoki,"I agree with your first point, it's impossible to memorize everything, which is why AI tools have become such a blessing for developers. Instead of wasting time Googling or digging through stackoverflow threads, we can get straight to the point.

Yet, some developers are still against using AI tools for coding. They prefer the traditional ways of searching for solutions manually, or in some cases, it seems to come down to ego. They argue that AI generates bad code but the truth is, you can always review and tweak the output. It’s a starting point, not a final product.

Burnout is real. I’ve been there. What’s scary is that many people don’t even realize they’re going through it. That happened to me last year I constantly felt sleepy, unmotivated, and didn’t want to work. After looking it up, I realized those were symptoms of burnout. The endless client requests and constant changes wore me down, and I started to hate coding.

But when I started using AI to help with coding, it made a huge difference. It saved me hours, even days, by providing boilerplate code or templates I could build on. AI isn’t perfect, but it makes solving problems much faster and takes some of the pressure off."

@Jacu.13c,"This is exactly what I needed <3. I've been in a bad strike of 3 years switching from job to job, being completely unable to specialize, and I was feeling like I was being left behind. I'm starting to trust a little more in myself and try to not get punished so hard by the impostor syndrome. Let's keep coding!"
@deca396,"trying to figure out how to develop games on godot, hopefully this video is true"
@akinwumipelumi1295,"Thank you so much, sometimes I get confused and feel like giving up because I don’t get to write the finest code like my tutor.  But like you said, the aim is the result not how the code looks. Appreciate man! ❤"
@MrNice-zm9qk,"In the business since 17 years now, and every word is correct!"
@m1cannas,The total picture under 10 minutes. 
@KO5II,"""Nobody cares about your code""
That one is one of the most important to me.
I promised myself not to rewrite my game's code untili finished it. I was stuck just rewriting code because I wanted it to be perfect, instead of making the rest of the features."
@pablomercaderalcantara5740,"All of those are good, think I've made every one of those mistakes and still have this sublime filling that programing and working with computers is so cool. :-) thanks for the video."
@stellarfrog-j3c,"I taught myself most of it. But I always knew that you can't become a professional just by watching videos. I always watched one video and took notes, but then I wrote my own projects, and that's how I quickly became confident and learned everything well."
@Lorant1984,Some usefull tips there that applies in general not just for coding.
@mlg4035,"The only problem with this is that the people that do the hiring, DO expect you to know everything. None of this will help you succeed in a coding interview if they ask you about specific algorithms, design patterns, or object constructs, etc., will it? I am perfectly confident in being able to figure out how to accomplish almost anything in Python or JavaScript, precisely because I DO have good 'detective' skills and Googling skills, and have developed an intuition for solving problems. But I can't really say 'Let me Google that' in an interview. Do you see what I mean?"
@corvynyan,"Video is so amazing and helped me with my current project. Thank you so much! Sadly I noticed a german YouTuber copied your video, which came out like 4 days ago. Wording almost matches perfectly what you are saying. Breakpoints/Topics of this video are the same, even in the same order. It's sad to notice something like this, since you did a great job with the video. Inspiration is fine, but just copying unnecessarily ist just wrong. 

I still appreciate your content since it saved me some time and hopefully will save some in the future. Have a good one!"
@hamzaalvi8198,thanks
@amtam05,"""It took me 10+ years to realize what I’ll tell you in 8 minutes""

One of the more popular clickbait titles of recent times."
@mvandamsingha573,"I am an amateur, and how shall I thank you for this? T-T It really helped me not to loose hope. Really, thank you, Pete. I never got such wonderful lovely msg for programmers <3"
@axel_r_,"Instructions not clear. 
I was at an interview and asked about my coding skills.
I answered ""nobody cares about your code"".
I am now a chef, since that is as close to development I can get atm."
@GoodTechConf,"""nobody care about your code"".... except when you work on a giant project, let say a banking system, you have to make sure the project stay maintainable for years, including when you are gone. This adivce is vaguely ok for small projects, like web stuff that will no longer exists 1 or 2 years later, but for big project this is a big no no ! They care... a lot !"
@DG-jq2jq,You sound like you googled most basic questions. Seriously middles with 1 year could answare better.
@ILOVEMYPG,"I graduated a few months ago from web and computer programming I felt like a loser because I am not the best at coding, you just made me realize you don't have to be perfect, you just have to be there till you become one, thank you, I felt related to most of the topics you mention"
@abcmaya,"I agree with every single one of them. I'm also glad taking a break made the list. 
Whenever I get stuck, I just take a nap. And after waking up, I'm able to solve the problem most of the time."
@kosiktomas,"I realize that but by my own, trough the years of coding :D but yes still nice to heard that from someone else that it's true."
@Karp22_,"Man, one thing I'm struggling with is that this is my first tech job. I'm assigned tasks, Jira stuff and all that. Sometimes I spend like a week or two just working on one or two of them, and that scares me. I start thinking, “Oh man, I should be able to do this in a day, this isn’t that hard, I must be bad at this.” Even though my boss tells me he’s proud of my work, I still beat myself up with those thoughts. This weekend, I spent hours just trying to figure out how to disable a button based on a flag."
@chriskindler10,"you say you’ve been programming since 2012, yet you’ve been a professional for over 13 years? I’m confused."
@Sand.,"i wish i had this video when i first started, would of saved many months of lost time due to burn out"
@NewsApocalypse0,Amazing Video. If I may ask are you from Cyprus?
@kewpie-cat,"great tips, very encouraging. especially for a zero-programming-knowledge nut like me. thank you"
@doctor_no_,Hi! Your accent sounds like mine! Are you a Cypriot?
@shashank1914,❤❤
@saudgl,"Write code very will if its in requirements says use this and to test etc .. otherwise don’t. I just got this from you Thank you.

I don’t know why I’m really care about make it easy and look good and using Test practice for everything ,while its just one time code"
@grinbeard,This is fantastic. Thank you for the wisdom here.
@sofiandaghsen343,"Fantastic! , with around 8 years of test development, I really agree on every word you said !"
@OPatron24,The cooking analogy was spot on!
@إيهابالكمالي-ك6و,You do not need to know everything. <---amazing
@Laoseng29,"magic speech... i know my english is broken, but i know everything you are speaking... these concept really helpful, i just work in this job about 2 year.. i just realize these point you said in last 1~2 month after me resign from my job. 
""Nobody care about your code"", ""Perfection is a trap""... 
This reminds me of a meme... 
""I build a system can handle millions of concurrent users, process terabytes of data in real-time, use kafka, redis, CQRS, microservices — the whole enterprise-grade architecture!😆"", ""wow😲, how many active users in your system?"", ""one🙂""."
@mastermind1089,"im a stay at home dad. i went to college and got a degree in something else. failed in my career. now i have a useless degree and have been learning code for a few years. i have no official credentials. how do i get myself to a place where i could be hired without the degree? i love game dev, but i need to know what i need to know in order to do it. how do i not waste my time? what is good enough? where do i go from here?"
@zioamYT,"Think, think again, take action, does it work?, add more stuff, and lastly, optimize and make it nice."
@celina9392,Wow this video changed my entire view on coding. ❤
@vbcreations1445,The video was very helpful 
@Sodomantis,and remember in 2027 codding jobs will be obsolete. So go have fun klids
@Waz444YT,Thankss man this helps me a lot like i also thought i need to learn everything before start smthing but now u resolved my thoughts thanksss ❤ the new Subscriber 👍

@apeamiru7708,"thanks, I always scared for start make an app, but your point about ""you'll never feel ready"" really hit me. maybe I'll start make something tomorrow"
@JeanneCorcuera,"Thank you. My problems were perfection is a trap, I never felt ready and got burnt out."
@whopclippers56,i dont waste my time code is needed in the days you when you want to build a game on play store you need to do code lol i know you do it the video for views thank you
@jamal3537,Stay calm when nothing works..Wow..That's what I needed to hear.
@salacryl,"Dangerous. Perfection may be a lie, but on your claim I could go ""meh. It's working- So who cares?"". right? No. Technical debt, Real life issues (like medical care software). It's NOT about perfection. It's about maintenance and reliability."
@joseantonioricardibermudez5919,"Great advices , thanks for sharing I am in the process of pivot my career from Oil and Gas engineer to programmers or may be the bridge between those two disciplines, however, I feel I can’t do it because I believe programmers know everything . I have already built my own Python programs that work. Thanks for all knowledge sharing"
@memoryleakerz,"The burnout one is truly real, these days I dedicate my weekends for the project, and try to make progress. Even if I didn't ship any feature but I spent for example searching on how to implement OIDC or OAUTH solutions - I'm absolutely fine, research and learning is a BIG part when you're working on your own projects and thats how you get to know with cool tools, solutions, stuff you didn't know exist

Memorizing, I used to think that I need to know out-of-the-box all solution's structures like how to write a redux store / reducers and know these and that tools, etc... Now I try to understand the basics of structures, protocol, flow-of-things such as network, auth, e2e experience for the user and it helps me ALOT on architecting my projects and come up with solutions, there is no subsitute for planning how your app is going to work"
@nich78olas,I dunno about that number 6 Nobody Cares... Depends where you work but at least you should. My advice to young devs is basically number 4. I tell them to commit to anything interesting enough to pull them through the learning curve.
@adammobile7149,My code is always perfect. Maybe because I do it for many years.
@kasrahosseini7380,"i just needed to someone tells me that if i search for a way to sort a list of tuple based on second index of tuples, that doesn't mean i am doing it wrong

@doctorxpop1458,Thank
@hammadranaa,Thank you for this! I used to think the same
@serapheogen,Since 2012 with that computer lol? How old are you?
@nickrowan,"I've been a programmer for 30ish years, 25 of them professionally and I had imposter syndrome for all of them. This is all 100% spot on, problem solving is the biggest thing here but also be aware that a large part of your time is going to be spent doing tedious stuff. Maybe AI will help take some of the boring stuff away but we'll have to see.
I've switched to being a DBA/data engineer/analyst at the moment because I burnt out on Dev but if I feel the call of Dev in the future I might switch back :)"
@Reminder_Reality,You'll Never Be Ready 💯
@rnz2363,"Honestly, if you still need to google how to get the last item of an array after 10 years as a programmer, it could be an issue. It's one of the most basic thing. Not even on the language level but just algorithmically speaking."
@assasin101011,Tip today use ai haha dont think others
@dncbot,"I agree with everything but #6, the next developer (which might be yourself) do care about the quality of your code.

Perfection is not possible, that I agree with, but a certain amount of cleanliness that makes it possible to understand what's going on, infer intention and make changes without everything breaking."
@neizvestniydrug,Let that man cook! Right on every point!
@ivory404,really cool and true fact! agree on every single one of them
@2goku272,Great vid thanks
@prostmahlzeit,Forgot the most important tip. Always clean up before pushing your code. Work in progress code always contains some experiments and only in the end you have enough insights to simplify it
@cronopios20,how would you be a professional programmer for more than 15 years if you started in 2012 and you where a baby?
@hassejansson,"Web developers is being replaced by AI tools, change your expertise.. that's what you need to realize! 😎"
@DitzDj,"Over 30years coder here, but toke me less than 10 years to realize most of these tips. My main tip is: Readability. It will help alot on debugging, making ""perfect"" code and more sustainable for future changes. So, do spend some time on variable and function names, but feel free to use ""stupid"" names 1st, after all it's working, take a break and ask a colleague or ChatGPT/CoPilot for better names. With good names, the problem just ""solves it self""..."

@shourya-pratap22,you!
@gaetano853,"Thank you fro this pearls of wisdom. Absolutely true. But please remember that ""Works on my laptop""  sometimes does not apply when it goes to prod :-))"
@Avean,"I second this. I struggled to learn stuff through tutorials until i started on Codeacademy where you got an online editor next to the video, and you were forced to remember and code after each lesson. That was super effective. So definetely spend more time doing stuff than listening to a tutorial/guide."
@chrispawn5000,I wish someone would have told me everything before I started coding in 2021..

@emel-lista,"So I should not videos at all? Or it is just that I shouldn't rely mostly on those? But I have this problem that my brain really feels blank, even building small and most basic programs makes me go crazy😥. So far I can somehow understand Python a little bit but when it comes to C++ -I just can't get the logic of anything and everything😢. I take an IT course, hoping that my brain finally works, I wanna learn but no matter what I do it feels like that I can really learn anything😢."
@underwater_ai,"ive been coding for over 30 years. Now I mostly review ai generated code, help it get unstuck from time to time, and occasionally step in to manually rewrite poor architectural decisions it makes. And over time the amount of my interventions has noticeably decreased as the ai improves. I guess everyone can see where its all going."
@iavadin9601,"How exactly did you save me 10 years? We work, we get paid. It doesn't matter much how the code looks like, we get paid. So.... What are you talking about???"

@christophery8927,Use chat bots to code! Sorted.
@warlordsquerk5338,"A couple of things:

0:22 ""You don't need to know everything"" Technically correct but you really do want to learn as much as possible about a language. Your senior coworkers will not treat you well if your a junior not constantly learning more about the language. The less questions you need to ask, the happier they will be. It sucks but you can't avoid it. Seniors do no realize how much they know or how long it takes to get there when dealing with a Junior. Protect your career by learning what you can before you start the job and keep learning a bit almost every day so you already know what something does more of the time when you're reading code others wrote. The less help you need, the more likely you are to keep a job. It doesn't matter how fair it is, it's how most people will treat you.

5:47 The ""No One Cares About Your Code"" only applies if there aren't other coders reviewing your code. Because those guys really will care a lot"

@RyanCR,"I used to code for a certain project a while ago, and I really wish the leader of that operation understood the last 2 sections.

@amirhoseini3563,"really good video ,thank you"
@Isaaccamher,thanks
@pb0xAF09,"""don't let perfect be the enemy of good""....not my quote, forget where I heard it. That said, software involving 'functional safety' (life & limb risk) is another beast at another level. One other thing, don't let these reasons allow you to be too casual...otherwise you're just building 'technical debt' that will bit you in the *ss at some point, where whole packages must be rewritten."
@BrawlerFN1,Best dev video of the decade <3
@emilichannel,Bro aged 30 years in 10.
@maefiosii,"bro aged 25 years since 2012, jokes aside great video"
@usroasi,"Can't disagree more about #6. Boss should care about the quality of your code simply because it makes everyone's life who will ever touch your code that much easier. It will be easier to read, it will be easier to improve or replace and it will simply work better. Your client/user indirectly cares about your code. How many times have you had a software crash or slow performance. 9 times out of 10, the cause is poor code. It's a very dangerous path to not learn the quality of code when learning how to code. It will become a snowball of bad habits very quickly. Nobody may be looking under your sink but plumbers do appreciate clean job too when they have to go after another plumber."
@nicolaipersson94,"Goddman... This video hit me right where I needed it, as a startup independent software developer I really needed these advices so thank you for sharing your well earned gold nuggets."

@messimessimessi10-u7n,thank you
@GachaGambler-f2p,The thing about not knowing everything. Yes Indeed sometimes I do forget syntax and forget the exact funtion name so I just search it up and get it working. I know how to use them it's just I forget what they look like sometimes. These functions are rarely used that's the most common reason I guess.
@Chugy_the_only_once,Very nice video.

@nickreaper6624,Who tf still codes manually anymore
@johngonzo6749,Such simple things you covered I think most people qualified to code no these things already. I watched this video and I didn’t learn anything…… you know maybe be more specific like the whole point of coding
@ihateevilbill,"I've been coding for 40 years now and these tips are great for beginners.
I've also been teaching coding for about 30 years (on and off) and most of these tips are some of the first I pass on.
My youngest son, for example, is into coding. He's 11 and I'm pretty sure we've gone over all those points. He was also worried that his code wouldn't be very good (moving from scratch to javascript), but thats the secret... we all started somewhere.
New coders need to realise that it takes time, but you will eventually get to the same point as us. It just takes practise. And even now, I'll look back on code thats only 2 or 3 years old, and my brain will go ""what was I thinking?"" XD
My javascript from 5 years ago, for example, looks little like my code today. And Im sure in 5 years time, it'll look totally different again.
The only other thing you need to be a good coder is that childlike curiosity to figure out how things work at a fundamental level. It will bring you joy when you find a solution."

@manosvenianakis9323,"Not a coder.. These advices, works on every field!"
@talatriaz,Great advice.
@foamheart,#6: I disagree. The person who has to maintain my code cares very much about my code. And he/she will curse me for not writing clean code. I write for that person. The unsung hero. Also because most of the time I am that person.
@michaelben-ikheloah4913,"You'll never be ready, just start anyway"
@wertigon,"Nobody cares about your code - until some stupid schmuck need to fix it for a new usecase, six years later. Often, that schmuck is you.

Write maintainable code to the best of your ability, but don't lose sleep over hackish good-enough solutions, either. Just document the ugly in an internal document (or even comment), and move on."
@Silberling86,">20 years of dev. I‘d like to add things! Most Important: no matter how experienced you are, you will make those mistakes he warned you about. Don’t be ashamed to be wise and still make mistakes but you need to know your way out. Next thing: perfection is not the goal but I’ve seen devs give a shit about quality, too. And that s a problem, too. You need to have standard that are reasonable, especially when working with other people. They might need to work with your code. And finally possibly the most important node when working with other people: the team matters. It does not help fighting one who is bad. You may not be able to make him / her better either. Sometimes accepting the situation and making the best out of it is all you can do. Important is: stay positive and constructive, not negative. I’ve been in a bad team, thankfully I left. Contributing to maintain a good environment is more worth than being the perfect developer."

@dus10dnd,"Great programmers sure seem like they have the entire language in their brains.  The reason is because they try to get at least the core language and the libraries that they regularly use stuck in their brains.  They read documentation and they deconstruct how the JavaScript engines work so they understand what is happening under the hood.  They also learn the language the engine is written in.

A good plumber takes pride in their work and is going to make sure it looks fantastic even if nobody is going to look.  They're going to make sure the next plumbers does a double take and doesn't have any problems working on the plumbing."
@planktonfun,"focus on the end result, unlike engineers, programmers have the perks to undo and redo things, make mistakes fast, often and early and then stick to whichever works
if someone tells you to make no mistake (and you can't copy paste code you have to type it), they are not real programmers they are posers with dunning krugers and no experience on real work that tries to sabotage you to protect their job position, yeah im looking at you daniel, youre very strict but your product is inadequate at best"

@Dragonsphinx,"5:50 As an IT student, this is actually a huge relief. Biggest stress I’ve had is that I’m worried my code is “uglier” than that of an “actual dev”. It works, but it’s “too ugly”. (And no, it’s not “Yandere Dev” ugly—I know how to use a switch case and my code IS legible. I mean that, for example, I avoid using ternary operators since I personally find them hard to read. I’m always worried that I should be writing things more compactly, and I’m not yet confident on all the ways I can condense my code.) If no one actually cares what it looks like so long as it works, then this takes off a massive bit of stress."

@Isawadigitalferrari,"I'll save everyone even more time. Don't pursue programming with hopes of getting a job in it. Do it for fun. The moment it stops being fun quit. The field is oversaturated and I've spent 7 years in college (community college + university) I have a bachelors in computer science and I'm working the same exact job I was doing before college after college. The only money to be made in the field now is telling people that the field is booming and selling naive new comers courses or bullshit youtube videos. 

fuck you op."
@tropotek,"With over 20 years we development experience, I have to say you hit all the major points. 
I still feel I over re-factor a lot of code at times, but generally only as I gain new knowledge in those areas. 
But the truth is, a client really only cares if it works (or more importantly, if it does not!) and how much will it cost, focus on those as the highest priority. 
Oh and another important factor, never underestimate the time cost (at least double your initial assumption... ALWAYS!!!)

Thanks for the vid. ;-)"
@TheSpidermint,"I'm a developer of 20+ years. The problem I see now isn't so much code, it's really poor tech stacks and workflows. Libraries and frameworks mashed together for quick wins and fudged outcomes. Developers trying to crowbar new tech into unsuitable projects without even understanding how it works. I believe this has been coined as vibe coding. Any code being ""written"" (AI or from stack overflow) seems to be hacking/patching the bits that don't work properly."

@krux02,"What I learned in 20 years of experience:
 * Don't waste your time with webtech, it's bloated, it's complicated. And the solutions are often broken in many parts. It's impossible to actually understand how a browser works for a beginner. Too many solutions are just flailing around and sticking with whatever kind of works.
 * OOP rarely helps to solve a problem. Don't force OOP to anything. Non OOP solutions are often easier to maintain and faster to execute
 * Stop looking for libraries to solve every tiny detail of your software. If you think of solving it yourself, your are getting better, and you actually understand the solution you use and can adapt it, if necessary.
 * Stay away from frameworks. Frameworks don't compose. You can give up your main loop only once, and that's even too much. Frameworks prevent you from actually understanding what is going on in your software, and if something is wrong with them, the only path forward is getting the lube ready an bend over (figuratively).
 * Memory layouting and CPU caching is actually very very important. Could cause a 100x performance difference. Don't lock yourself into languages, where you have no control over that. Learn at least one of these languages for that: C, C++, Rust, Zig, Odin, Nim, Go (there are probably more that I can't name right now, but certainly not anything with Java* in its name)
 * Don't fix issues in your coworkers code, before communicating and them understanding and agreeing, that there is a problem. And then ask if you may fix it. Coworking can get really sensitive if you touch their precious."
@prapto-q9o,"5:47 - ""Perfect code"" whatever that means is not - in itself - a goal.

I hate it when people say that code quality doesn't matter or no one cares about your code. It's not about whatever arbitrary perfection you're chasing - it's about: can you evolve and maintain the code quickly and effectively to adapt to future business needs and growth without introducing bugs or performance issues. All the classic ""rules"" are just tools to achieve this in different contexts. The end goal of good and clean code is that you can keep moving fast and delivering quality in the other things you noted customers and bosses care about.

One example consequence of viewing it this way - if you're writing a one off tool that you and the people you're building it for see very little chance will ever be extended - go ahead and lower your standards significantly if that helps get it out fast. If you find out you were wrong and it does start evolving and let's say does so 3 times - then consider what tools would be useful to start using - maybe only in new code or maybe you rewrite it while it's small. If the former - if you're still extending it long after 3 times then you could choose to invest in going back and fixing whatever the original part was.

The above is just one example scenario - but notice how it's directly connected to the actual business problem and needs being solved for, instead of sitting in an abstract ""I was taught this tool and therefore must use it"" default mode.

I'll end by saying that dear god I ----ing hate working with people who don't care at all about the meaning of names, consistency, structure, etc. Those are all tools to make it easier to load all the context you need - and only what you need - back into your head when you come to the code again such that you can know what to do, do it, and do so without breaking things quickly. Ideally (and again this would apply for something that is likely or proven to need extension/maintenance) it would also enable people just coming to the tool to ramp up much faster - or maybe just even enable it in the first place by making it so they don't have to read your ----ing mind and see all the context and assumptions you didn't make explicit in the code (which then lead to endless bug and churn hell as they trip over them constantly if it's something non-trivial).

This is particularly bad given that if I need to read every line of code in a project to know what the hell is going on in one area such that I can modify it with confidence that I'm not introducing edge cases/race conditions/etc - it takes more cognitive energy from me than I have and I descend into a long bitter voyage to hell as the rest of my life withers and I start debating whether being alive is worth it (software engineering is my only monetization skill currently unfortunately - and working in environments like I'm describing makes it damn near impossible to make any real progress on learning anything else).

Good code - first off isn't about arbitrarily applying every ""good code"" tool you've learnt everywhere - and is for YOU and YOUR FELLOW AND FUTURE DEVELOPERS.

Completely dismissing/disregarding it (which I've had to work with before) is infuriating, arrogant, and short sighted - unless you're working on one of those things that never gets touched again (and how often does that assumption turn out wrong - so even with that why not at least name and structure things well and as close to what you're documenting as possible and use comments to note things you're ignoring, assumptions you're making, and so on (or better yet asserts)."

@jorg1piano,"I mean, knowing the language seems like a bare minimum. You should know your programming language incredibly well. You certainly don't need to know everything, but you should know your language. Knowing the syntax of the language is, in my opinion, the most important thing to master to be useful at all.

I work with data science/engineering and always considered myself a good problem solver. I started just recently to dive more on the dev side to start buildin web apps, however during this, I would sometimes be too hard on myself because I couldn't memorize code that I considered basic, just because I thought the ""real devs"" would remember everything, open their computer and started coding super fast.

I had my app deployed on Play Store, everything that is needed to appear as a serious dev but never apply for a job.

@InvoicerX,"As a software developer, more specifically an app developer, it has always been my dream to learn how to code. I watched hundreds of hours of tutorials how to get started in VSC, how to write the first line of code, what HTML is, what CSS is, how CSS works, what JavaScript is, how to connect it all, etc. But after all those hours, I still didn’t know how to write or even start my first line of code in VSC!

The key isn’t knowing everything it’s learning how to think like a programmer and understanding the elements and how to connect them. After building about ten websites, I still wasn’t satisfied until I switched to creating apps for Google Play.

Today, I have one of the top business-class apps in Croatia.
The moral of the story is: don’t give up, and don’t worry if you don’t know how to write every single line of code."
@VG.Prints,"Thanks I needed to hear that. I finished a fullstack dev bootcamp and after that I felt like I couldnt even try to work because I had to time to process all that I felt like I needed to know and lost the focus on what's really important — learn to think like a programmer and the syntax and all of that will become easier long term .

@lulolean,"Speaking as a software safety engineer from a safety critical industry, I would add my top three: 1) configuration management is foundational—lose it and you lose all confidence, 2) know and document the properties the integrated system needs to hold (for example, the API, the requirements) and validate your software against that, and 3) SHIFT LEFT:  model the design of your software, because no human brain can hold all the structure, and the costliest bugs are a result of poor design."

@activex7327,"5:40 - That statement is half truth. Although what you said is partially correct, looking from a certain angle, that's not how it works in real life. You should care about your code, otherwise, maintaining it will be difficult, and expensive for the client. In a team setting, your engineering department cares about your code for same reasons and more, like productivity. If you write poor code, you will be unemployed."

@scottguitar8168,"Certainly good advice. I suppose I am an odd ball in that I intuitively understood your advice as a very curious kid looking to understand the world around me back in the 60's and 70's. While I went into electrical engineering because computer science was not on my radar back then, your advice is really applicable to any problem solving field. There is simply too much to know, but learning to ask the right questions will get you what you need to know. 

I have always been a great problem solver and the one thing I notice that I have that many others don't have is the ability to not run out of options to try and questions to ask. I remember a project where another engineer and electrician where attempting to figure out why 5 computers around our plant would not communicate in a network. They spent a year intermittently working on the solution. The project was turned over to me and the instructions for communications was only about a page long. The problem is the writer wrote a problematic paragraph that in my mind could be interpreted in a multitude of ways. I spent the next few days applying the different ways the paragraph could be interpreted until I had success."

""Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.

I heard this from my mentor in first year, but I was a stupid stubborn perfectionist and couldn't understand it all.
Naturally, I learn it the really hard way over the years. I had a chance to listen, but I wasted it.
Don't waste your time like I did."

@matewka,"I'll emphasise on one of the most popular principle: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). DRY is great but it's an enemy of the Developer Experience. Code needs to be clean but it also needs to be understandable by other devs. So if you're a fan of DRY principle, add an AHA principle to it (Avoid Hasty Abstractions)."
@wyea,Wow! I'm really happy to find this video. I need motivation to back to code after years of void.
@Arlequin___,"Not really agreeing with the ""nobody cares about your code"", your coworkers and even yourself will probably have to go through your code again, and you can create a huge technical debt if you don't take time to write your code in the best way.

@ILyaCyclone,"Mate, take note on ""write code that works"" and ""nobody cares about your code"" and your colleagues will hate you in no time. 👍
Once upon a time my very productive colleague left the job, and the team had to basically rewrite everything he did from scratch, because the code was completely not readable, not maintainable and not extendable. He did wrote the code that worked ... only while he was there, right."

@anotherguy4685,"Pro tip: Just as hes said you don't need to know everything out of your head, however, there is something important that needs to be said because some people don't realize it and I am going to provide you an example.

Suppose there is a package that everyone wants to use and ask for it in their job posts, I won't mention any by name... *cough* Redux *cough*. Think you memorized exactly how to use it and implement it and write every declaration, and do it by memory perfectly, what happens is that if you don't continuously check how to use it you WILL MISS updates, new ways to structure it, new ways to use it, and even worse... alternatives to it!

So keep checking the documentation, keep searching for state management packages, you might have miss on others that are simpler, easier and just as good if not better.

The same goes for regular day to day JavaScript functions, like array functions, object functions, etc. Some become irrelevant, some become deprecated, and also you get new ones every now and then."

@Warkillable,I have only professionally did web development mostly on the design end but touched on JavaScript and C# a little trying to become a coder. I remember how proud I was of my self just creating a 3D platform with a small square in the middle that acted as a character moving around and jumping. It was extremely simple but I set it as a goal to making something that worked in a 3D environment. One thing I always have a serious issue with is not feeling like I'm ready or good enough to code like you said and honestly I still feel that way.

@gitaristangakawntant3038,"""how not to burn the house down"" - this got me hahaha"
@OntdraadSpeldInnen,"Aha! So you are the one that promote ""it works-anyone can do it"" shitty coders. That is real problem in this kind of field, too many of them. In fact it fits the trends market fine of disposable software. Nobody gives a shit how it is made, it needs to work (sort of). Flashback example, what would happen to Nintendo when they released their NES with this kind of programmers with a imperfect way of knowledge? Do you think it was successful anyway? I don't think so. You need to understand what you are doing and perfection isn't a lie, you need knowledge to be good at it. A search engine only (or to know how to search) is not the key to succes. Totally BS."

@Antonio_Luna1899,"""Learn how to learn"" — I definitely agree with that! As a designer, continuous learning is essential since information evolves rapidly. 

What you know today might already be outdated a year from now. 

That’s why it's impossible to learn and be ready at 100% rate — but knowing how to learn helps you keep up."

@dariusv5216,"I also wanted it to be perfect and if now do not perfectly, I still think that some other dev ""bite"" me when he see something not perfect done by me. And how nobody cares - I do not agree. I hear comments - ""what a shit code"" or smth like that. Yea, not the client, not boss if they do not have to work with this code or hire other devs who would want to work with this coide.  not user - yea , he cannot see this code."

@GreatWildWolf,"I agree with pretty much everything that's been said except the part about writing good code. Lack of concern about the quality of the code and its performance is why we have so many bad developers these days. Sure, if you're low on time, just make it work, but don't forget to refactor stuff later when possible. If you don't worry about the quality of your work you will never improve it. It's hard to reach where you aim for, but if you aim for perfection chances are you will become at least ""very good"". Aim for ""enough"" and you end up being mediocre. But again, it all depends on the time you have in your hands... after all we also need to deliver."

Do I feel ready for anything? Feel tired, I feel that I was in my comfort zone like decade ago, I missing my enthusiastic curiosity that drove me for years. Now my company expects that I'll be developer, devops, sysadmin, network guy, architect... what is sad? I'm trying to stand up to this expectations despite knowing that is f.. impossible."

@MariusSchwendtmayer,If I had any advice to give to new devs is specialize in something. Don't worry if it takes 20 years. If in 20 years you're writting AOT compilers‚ target tracking software for military planes‚ next gen pinbale frameworks‚ real time concurrent system solutions‚ TV software or whatever it's a win. Web is the main door to programming. Breaking free from web is the door to heaven.

@antonio.carreira,"Thank you so much for this video!!
I'm sure I knew all of this already, but I really needed to hear it. As a 20+ years self taught developer, it really touched all my pain points.
Burnout is real, and it can do a lot of damage. It can affect the project you're working on and all your future projects.
Done is better than perfect should be tattooed on my wrists, so I had to look at it all day long. :)

As a side note, AI made it a lot easier to learn and search for stuff. I'm using Copilot inside VSCode, and I don't even have to leave the editor to search for something. My productivity and knowledge level both sky rocketed, and the amount of distractions decreased by a lot. AI is getting a bad reputation because of vibe coding, but if you know what you're doing and you know what to ask, it can be a really powerful tool."
@EthanELiTeZ,"Hi I have a question but first I wanna share something. 

I am heading into my final year of computer science this september, I literally cannot code on my own, I understand what something does but struggle to do it myself. This summer I could have definitely put some self learning in but I needed a break from education, but I still have like another month and few weeks so maybe sometime soon. The last 2 summers I was doing games development I made some games in unity but struggled to even do it on my own but very slowly I managed to do a few things on my own (I also do games dev module on my course).

This is a question for anyone really, any type of coding job... When you first started your coding job did you deeply struggle so much you had little to no idea what to do? But also felt like when working there for longer period of time you learned more on the job than you did at your college/university? 

I am just really nervous for when that time comes to be honest."

@wifi_warlord,"Pete, great video. I've been off an on learning and building websites and ecommerce for a decade. I'm dedicating the next 12 months to sit down every day to write code. I went back to freeCodeCamp for their full stack developer. As I go through their program I'm doing exactly like you have said here ""just get started"". So even though I'm working through their course work. I've writing my own dev blog on a day by day basis showing examples of what I've learned. However, I am utilizing MDN docs to add to and expand what I'm learning through that course. Haven't finished their HTML portion, but I've already added CSS and JS to the page because well I know the docs exist.
To add, with my current job, which is very customer forward, I'm playing with the idea of form which can be saved or emailed for data entry. Tired of packing bundles of paper to get signed and draw pictures of properties. It would be so much easier if it was one form with the ability to use something like google maps for marking property utilities.  Cheers.. I'm subbed.. There's obviously more I can learn form you."
@fayaz_code_academy,"All the points really hit but these two points hit different :

@salluridilip3802,"I started my career in 2019 as a web developer. However, I’ve always had a fear of coding. In my first company, I was assigned a task that took me two weeks to complete, and I had to work under a lot of pressure. I stayed there for just three months before deciding to switch to testing.

Since then, I’ve been working in manual testing for the past three years. But now, with the decreasing demand for manual testing in the market, I’ve started learning Java and JavaScript for automation. Still, I find myself scared of coding questions—especially those related to strings, loops, and arrays. There's a fear inside me, but after watching your video, I gained some confidence. I realized that I need to keep practicing consistently, even if I don’t fully understand everything or struggle while solving problems. I’ve learned not to give up and to keep pushing forward.

Sometimes, I can explain the logic of the code, but I get stuck while writing it, can you suggest me anything on this problem?

                                                       thanks"
@chaz-e,"No one cares about the code, they care of what it does.

This is true for freelancing projects but in corporate setup the tech lead or peer reviewer do appreciate a well written code."
@Sirmarcanthony8,Excellent advice!
@__aladino__,Man thanks a lot! I really needed to hear that. 6+ years experience as a developer and I always felt like shit and the last in the world just because Im mastering one language and dont know how to program with other languages. Or like you said googling some function I forgot about. Even though my team leaders are always happy with my work. But I felt its not really good. They're just happy because I deliveres fast. I'll learn perfection slowly and not be hars on myself 🤙🏼

@VimalRaj-mr6by,Thanks Man.
@SecureFault,"There are no lies spoken here. I'm currently 15 years into my development journey and can confirm everything said is accurate.
Failure needs to be removed from our vocabulary as a four letter word. Failing is learning. Learning is failing. 
You are not a real developer unless you've brought down a production environment with your code at least once. Anyone willingly telling you they never have is doing so because they're either bragging (and everybody hates a bragger) or they're straight up lying to your face. Wrecking production at least once is an important right of passage for all developers. The key is to be open to learn as much as possible from that situation, every major mistake only needs to happen once (maybe sometimes twice) before you know what never to do again"
@jericho7100,Well bro fantastic...Every beginner should know what you just said...God Bless.
@thegrimmtv3532,Thank you for wasting 8 minutes of my time. This is exactly the mindset of the senior devs that don't know how to follow 1NF.
@NucleoNacional_ESP,"Honestly, for me, entering the open-source universe was literally a living hell 😂 like really traumatic...and what is sad is that many developers ""develop"" some sort of super ego that actually enjoy seeing the newbies suffer, and sometimes even play with them and make jokes, because it gives them some kind of supperior  feeling or something. I would tell them that if they have such a weak  self-esteem please go and seek professional help, but leave the Kids grow and thrive. Thanks God there are many individuals within the community like you, who are always up to help without any reservations. Shame they are not always as active as the little bad-elfs around"
@YassonTzdt,"Hi, thanks for this amazing video, everything seems true to me since what you told is what every dev experiments at in their jib life. So thanks again. Now, to answer to your last question you asked in the video, I would say burnout and taking breaks is the point I would love to know at the beginning, especially during my study"

@Zemario-y4j,"I'm currently a final year CS student and I feel like an imposter. I haven't completed a solo project before. 
I've learnt a few of these things along the way during mys studies but this video reinforced it. I feel much better now. 

This summer I've been contacted to work on a website for my church, I've never done this before and I'm scared but this video encouraged me to be willing to learn and just go for it. Besides, I have nothing to lose but to gain."

Coding was/is the fun part tho, but i cant bring myself to code rather than to play games or chill with friends. Ngl i always liked chasing bugs, sometimes it was frustrating for sure, but i liked the ""hunt"" the goal to have it fixed. Im soon out of university and im kinda scared to find a job, just cause i dont code in my freetime. Hopefully ill find smth xd"
@dndlimits912,THANKSSSS!!!
@VitaliyLL,"Great points. 
But regarding: ""no one cares about your code"" - it's very situational. I worked on several projects where ppl who probably had exact same words in mind, made their successors work 5x slower and more error prone 😅 so if your code would read someone, they do care ;) but chances are you would be far away so that would be their problem when it happens😂"

@ninjabeatz905,"Make it. Then make it work. And finally, make it appealing"
@Hyper_drive214,"I’m literally days into learning how to code a website. I heard something today about knowing vs understanding and you pretty much said the same thing about actually sitting down, practicing and trying to build something instead of watching all these videos. Then when it comes time for you to try it, you have no idea what you’re doing. But there are some things you have to learn from others. Like, yesterday I found out about emmet abbreviations and holy shit that motivated the hell outta me. Little tips like that make coding not seem so daunting."
@maxs6803,"I know I'll get some haters for this, but incidentally spending 3 hours to properly name a variable, especially as a junior developer,  and focused on a difficult situation, is NOT a waste of time.  It's thinking.  Just like writing is thinking.   It's the heart of proper documentation.   It forces you to understand what you are creating, and the relationship it has with other parts of your code.   When people say, ""well-written code requires few comments"",  90% of the time it's a result of proper naming.   Yes, 3 hours well exceeds the norms, but I think you learned a lot from that ""failure""... I had a similar experience when I had to name a class.   With more experience and thinking, naming gets faster and better... and as a result, code maintenance will become easier.  If you were a veteran developer, taking 3 hours to focus on naming one thing, yes, I'd 100% agree with you.   Bottom line, don't sell yourself short... I hope everyone experiences a ""naming crisis"" at least once in their career, it makes you a much better developer"
@crstudio-gb7xz,Programming is eternal learning
@DouglasJoshua-p5k,No code is perfect so why not just push
@Iluvyah,man tnx for being honest
@techbeginner-f4y,"You are not ready, Start Anyway. Perfection is a lie. This helped me a lot."
@markaven5249,"Perfection is only achieved through teams. When you're alone if you demand perfection on yourself, you don't realize that 'perfection' is made by multiple team members looking over code and making corrections. The same works with an animation studio, you have supervisors and multiple people that will look over a single sketch until it's production ready."
@chadasonmcgraw,"I, personally, had that ""aha, I am ready."" moment or feeling. I was VERY intentional with where I spent my time in tutorials. I focused specifically on things that taught me how to use my software (game engine in this case), and even more specifically, how to apply those lessons into my own ideas so I can survive on my own. I actually started my first game with TOO much confidence... then realized how hard it was to scale tightly coupled systems that have rigid hierarchies and hard coded logic in actors that would have been better as components... It's funny how that moment of feeling ready was great at getting me motivated to start, but also something that has caused me 2 massive refactors..."
@chadasonmcgraw,"Yes, yes, yes, and more yes! I have been saying this since I started game deving. You need to learn how to think in code before you write it. Your code has to have intent because the logic you write will need to perform a function, and that requires intent.

When you first start, it is 100% okay for you to have spaghetti code and hard code things (even though it is not correct and will not scale). That's how you learn why it doesn't work and can prepare to find solutions to avoid those mistakes. Keep learning how to avoid those pitfalls when designing your systems. Think ahead and ask questions. As you get more used to doing this, you will find how generalization and abstraction are huge helpers to avoid tight unintentional coupling. You will begin to realize that more generic code and smaller code actually makes debuging easier, and finding errors easier (finding errors can be harder than fixing them, but you need to have an idea of what to look for after you find the flaw). 

First, think about the code, plan the logic, walk through all the steps, their timing, and what dependencies are needed. Think about how the compiler will read the code. Then think about syntax. Once you have built what you planned, test it, test edge cases, test it forward and backward because end users will do random things, and you will want to account for that.

Accept you don't know all the answers. That is what QA is for. They will find the flaws you miss. So focus on making modular, scaleable, and generalized code that meets your basic needs, then build a bit more around that. Once you're happy with it, let people test your project. Then, fix what you were not aware of. Then, release it. Don't get stuck over engineering something that will never be released. A good engineer makes elegant code that can stand the test of time (if only they had said time to finish the project). The greatest engineer is one who ships their product."

@CharaAmine-f9l,"thanks for the advices mister I appreciate it, i started looking at html stuff and grinding it. (learning about its code and attributes etc) i managed to build like a small but a okay website via html only (i dont know java or python or CSS yet) and its been only 2 days since i started like learning and coding and actually using and making stuff. iam preparing myself because iam going to china in order to learn and not be new to stuff like these when i go there. (would like to learn webdeveloping or maybe work in cybersecurity) i just graduated like 2months ago. 17 years old atm. i just want advices that u can give or anyone who is experienced. am i walking the right path by like doing stuff like these. working on myself and learning this for like 5 hours a day/6 hours a day (learning AND coding) i aint the sharpest tool but iam committed to this because this will be my future."

@SavaiinaeaSilva-o2w,From somebody going through a really dark time right now. thank you this helped me. almost the whole video got me by surprise. I have been in this crazy state of depression lately. I isolated myself for the past 8 months. I go to work and I am back home in my room and I am staring at this screen trying to figure this thing out and I always have questions that I probably am too afraid to ask anyone because I don't look like I like to code or am interested in really how to do it. idk what I am t trying to say but thanks big dawg.

@alexkuhn3266,"Nobody remembers everything: In fact, I know several people I've worked with who remember almost everything they learn, at a very deep level. Even without ever having to put it into practice (like some things from university)! These guys made me think I was just bad at remembering. And they had achieved a very high level in a relatively short period of time.
I think after 13+ years in development, I can't even come close to the level of professional confidence they had after only a couple of years.

Many years later, I realized that I just have ADHD... and I remember things perfectly well even in detail if they are interesting.
But as soon as I solve a problem, the information needed to solve it is no longer important, and I forget it. So instead of a career ladder, I went on a career rollercoaster, up, down, up again. (If you have signs of ADHD, I recommend getting checked, methods of compensation can change your life dramatically)
ADHD in adults occurs in only 2-5% of the population, so I don't quite understand why neurotypical developers would have difficulty remembering something as simple as programming, where most of the problems have already been solved before us."

@kiSABREWULF007,How can you spend  4 hours on building something when you dont know how to do it ? I thing watching the tutorials is still good
@DKLHensen,"Huh? Programming since 2012 and you're a professional programmer for more than 15 years? So 2025 - 2012 = 13, but I guess you're rounding up to 15 and include the years programing as a kid in those 15 years."
@davidf6592c,"As a senior embedded dev, I didn't have high expectations for this video when it popped into my feed, I thought it was just the usual brain rot clickbait, but take note... this is good advice. I too reached every one of those conclusions, and it took a lot of stressful mistakes to figure it all out. Burnout is definitely real, and it sneaks up on you as well. One day you're heavily invested in a project, working extra hours, feeling focused and then the next day you think... WTF am I doing, this is a waste of my life and you have 0% motivation to code."
@OluwaseyiOgunsola-y5q,"Am really do impressed and grateful 
Sometimes i feel stuck and feel helpless because i do think i need to know everything to be a real developer 
I start learning coding wuth the help of chatgpt 
It has my roadmap am almost done learning python tben i caks across soke videos talking about other languages kike JavaScript, c++ and others.
To be sincere i really felt overwhelmed because even sometimes when gpt write codes I don't understand but i try all my best to cram it so i can be perfect 
Also, you takked about burning out to ne sincere i really wished i could spend like 5-7 hours on coding but it's not just possible 
Am an high school student abd i don't really have time 
I go to school every night from 7-10 to study and when am done i always feel tired tgat j can't just try to learn anything 
That really discourgae me because i feel helpless, i only gwt to learn coding during the day and i think that's not enough 
But thus really helped me i think i only need to work smart not hard 
Thank you 
I hope i get your response soon.."

@TKBlink,"""Nobody cares how clever your code is.""  I wish this were true.  I've witnessed a staggering amount of time wasted over the years from developers, tech leads, and dev lead managers arguing over best practices and demanding refactoring of code that already worked.  Or fellow developers refactoring code that wasn't part of their assignment and the original authors getting butthurt about it.  Or worst of all, QA that want to hold up a code delivery because they think the working code should be written another way.  There are still a lot of perfectionists and people that think way too much of their own opinions out there."

@elmoswvrld8,ALL THE INFORMATION YOU GAVE WAS USEFUL. EACH POINT HAD MEANING.
@kobra_style,"I agree with taking a break when you run into a problem that is not immediately obvious. I find my subconscious brain tends to keep working on a solution. When I get these aha moments it tends to do the opposite of burnout for me. It gives me a huge boost of motivation.

I think there is something to be said about writing clean code if someone else will have to look at it in the future. I work with a guy who I estimate has a 200+ IQ and every time I look at his code I learn something new and its always easy to determine what his thought process was. Then on the other hand I have looked at code and I shake my head and think what the fuck is going on in here. It looks like a tornado blew through the source code."

@thomask.7978,"I agree with everything you say and find it very encouraging that you say it and the way you say it. On one thing I think there is a an alternative view and that is where you say ""Nobody cares how clever your code is."" That is true in many cases especially if it is only you who writes the code. However 1) if you work in a team or you code something that is to be continued by someone else - maybe one day when you have moved on for other challenges - then the code should either be well structured and written or just stick with common coding standards. 2) When you work for a European bank or a company that provides critical infrastructure e. g. electric power plants you have to comply with regulatory rules that impose a coding code of conduct on you."

@trevorclips1,GAINED A SUBSCRIBER
@Ameer-Hamza-100,"here are key points:
You don't need to memorize everything in coding; knowing how to find answers is more important.

Shift from a passive 'consume mode' (watching tutorials) to an active 'create mode' (building projects).

Don't get stuck chasing perfection; 'done is better than perfect,' and shipping imperfect projects is crucial for learning.

You'll never feel completely ready to start a project or apply for a job, so you must start anyway.

The primary skill of a developer is problem-solving, not just writing syntax.

Focus on delivering value and creating functional products, as the elegance of the underlying code is secondary to the end-user.

Developer burnout is a serious risk; protect your energy by setting boundaries and taking breaks.

Embrace Googling and looking things up as a normal and essential part of the development process."

Leet code interviews have nothing to do with what software development and engineering is about."

@Medivj,"Mainly work in windows environments and started in powershell coding when i got frustrated that some repeated processes were not automated. after a couple months of banging my head to a wall got the automation completed and was a wonderful feeling... 
That was ~12 years ago and now i'm building azure automations, azure logic apps / power apps on the cloud end and powershell scripts for on-prem and hybrid customer environments and loving every single moment of it.
And this all started while knowing nothing about coding and then deciding to take the time and bang my head on the wall for a while to learn how to do it."

@JuliaReinhart-m9h,"oh and you guys for burnout here are my tips: Eat healthy, go outside, I skate, exercise, gym skate, and see friends, for me it's my sisters in my church/prayer groups (I skip the coffee, and try to eat regularly, even if it's hard, like bringing raq veggies on outings so when I get a minute I can eat). Then trust me, I am more of a delight for my fiance, with the boundaries I set with myself, stay reading the bible, listening to gospel while I code, singing, my goodness thank you Jesus that helps me"
@JuliaReinhart-m9h,"You know what praise God for this video. I'm working on AI engineering projects. Yea, teaching myself. On the job. And at first would code till midnight. But then we get burned out. So yea, skate go outside, eat healthy and take breaks to code. It's contract work for a smaller company with a family member I know who does backend not AI. Making my horrible first draft code, actually helps me know what to learn, sometimes I start over, but they have ZERO AI right now and I love helping them. Thank you Jesus for my blessings, I'm focusing on helping others not the pay. Yea we just need to try."

@UnitXification,"Here's what's funny about this: I'm a freelancer selling automation and AI-consulting services. I almost don't know anything about coding (yet). 

All services I have made by asking ChatGPT almost every step on how to do it. I just started doing it and when something didn't work I asked ChatGPT.

My customers don't know that. They only see that it works and that's what they care about. And of course I ain't gonna tell them.

I don't have imposter syndrom. It's quite the opposite. I laugh to myself that normies just don't get it. Because nowadays it's so easy to achieve almost everything you want if you get the knowledge.

And that is why I am learning coding too. I see the limits of my automation solutions and I have so many ideas which can only be achieved if I am able to code.

So I will learn everything about coding (simply because it's interesting, not because I need to) and will start coding ASAP. And if something doesn't work I can always ask my coach named ChatGPT.

Also, always ask yourself: If OpenAI can start selling their subscriptions fort ChatGPT a couple years ago even when it only worked like 50% of times correctly, why should you feel bad about selling stuff that isn't perfect? (Of course you should still TRY to be perfect or as good as possible. Don't be like OpenAI lol. It's about feeling bad that you aren't perfect, not about not trying to be.)"
@natesoffroad,Lol that's insane.. I never had much of an issue naming variables lol..

@vishnuvardhanreddymaditati8098,we never get feeling of professional until you start hits me more... super video
@Raptor850,"I've been working in development for over 10 years, and I disagree that no one cares about your code. In mature projects with high levels of quality, there are protocols that verify the efficiency and best practices you use in your code before any deployment (regardless of whether it works), since well-written code is scalable and easy to maintain.
It's true that this depends on the project, but there are cases where they won't let you deploy something if you don't do it efficiently."
@PJSOL47,Watching this video gives me hope of coding I'm a highschooler I wanna learn coding to create my own Ai companion and I really care about that project and yea burnout is real I very much believe it and through this video I see my self I'm not perfect smart or into science technology but this video answered my question about my self do I work hard or do I just quit entirely I'm not into maths etc but knowing this video exist I wanna continue that project of mine and maybe oneday I'll be creating modules for my companion solo no funding just creating and I wish new beginners see this to feel that they have what it takes to make it it's just doubting yourself this video help me and that's real.

In fact, I don’t agree with the idea that spending time on naming variables is a waste. It's actually important — it can massively help with debugging and remembering your own code, not to mention when someone else has to use it."
@prajithar6174,THE BEST VIDEO AT RIGHT TIME ❤
@theuselessbrick,"I'm getting into my 5th year of being a dev, and 5:48 is a truth I DEFINITELY needed to hear. I lost sleep over messy code that, although worked, looked like a frothing pile of moisty goat shit. It *WORKED*, but looked like fecal matter. Burnout up the ass, imposter syndrome, anxiety, and gastritis to add insult to injury. 

In the end nobody gave a flying fuck about the code I wrote except for the fact that it *worked*. This actually gave me some peace of mind. It granted me confidence to get STARTED and get shit working instead of worrying too much. A great advice indeed."
@youjean83,I’ve been in the industry since 2001. One phrase a senior developer used to say really stuck with me: “Our code is not holy/sacred—learn to let go!”
@lunaristic9981,This video is a gold mine
@KennTollens,"Watching tutorials and reading code books never helped me.  I had to start a project not knowing how to do anything and look up the parts as I went along. Open AI is great for learning the bits that are need as you go. The huge benefit is that it will code it in a good style so you can learn it the right way to begin with. I have been coding dynamic JavaScript for over a year now and along the way, the style sheets, DOM and html elements all fell into place and made sense."

@IMP3RFECT-GI,"One advice I wish i knew earlier that first explore the area which you are going to learn or do work in. like when i started to learn react native i was totaly confused what to do. html needed css js needed and some said react needed some said not, what i did was learn react basics then realising html and css should be learned and then js 
totally exausted and started over now with a little knowledge. if you want to learn a particular programming language just dive in but if you are learning things like web dev app dev or anything more complex than just a programming lang just explore the field first and learn what is done and what is needed."

@johndez9972,Also...any good free classes that teach coding for beginners

@SteveITGenius-t3y,These were the best programming tips I have ever found as a beginner! Keep going! Amazing!
@IndieGameDad,"All good tips. Key takeaways
- Learn to use Docs, the better you get at reading docs related to the language/engine etc, the more efficient you'll be
- You're going to Refactor. Nothing comes out perfect the first time, get a working state, then refactor later to make it cleaner if time permits
- Coding is essentially a fine dance of problem solving, not memorization"

After watching this video I found that I was too focusing on what's I don't know how to do, which is pushing me down.
And yes, I don't have to know or memorize every thing, try and error isn't that bad too!
I like how you said 'Debugging is the job. It's not a failure. It's the process.'

@a.ortega9909,"It's something I've been meaning to tell my teammates (including a group in India) they care so much about perfection that PR goes back and forth.

@rilufuzz,"My biggest frustration when initially started to learn C# and Unity, was when i wanted to try and apply what i had learnt up to that point i'd find myself staring at an empty VSCode. My mind would immediately just blank out. I kept telling myself i just needed to look at more tutorials and do more reading into what i wanted to learn, and ultimately i just burnt out. Fast forward a few years, and i decided to give it another shot with Python. This video was a real eye opener to be honest. Thank you!"

This is my fault, I should have probably let my mother chose this path, I cant choose any course since I dont have a dream job.

Well anyways thank you 🌹 it clears my head a lil bit, I guess I shouldn't worry too much. 

I talk too much again."
@not_mineshaft203,thanks brother wish this whole video came to me earlier. I always used to think that real developers doesn't write 2 lines code in hour they keep fluently writing line by line thats what also made me think to wait till I feel ready which I never felt and fact that I did courses but I never opened the second file of program myself.
@DogoDebs,"Thanks Pete!,I needed to hear this."
@gabrielroani8252,"Regarding the first tip, I once worked with a guy who started coding back in the late 90s here in Brazil. I asked him how he remembered so much code without googling, and he said they had to memorize everything back then. They didn't have internet on their computers, just one machine with a dial-up connection for the whole team to share for really important stuff."

@aram5280,Thank you
@BegForMyMercy,"I agree with this entire video. Been there felt every minute of this. Even though I know about 20 languages, I don't know them all 100%.. this video should be shared in college. When I problem solve, I try for 30 minutes, if there is no clue just yet, I go take a shower, I eat some food, I open up a game, then I get the idea of oh there's more than one way to make it work, and try the other avenue OR I crack the algorithm."
@darkopz,"Uh….  

Master Chefs have 100% memorized all the recipes they use. And then memorize all new ones they want to use. They also have the skills snf experience to make their own recipes. 

And yes there are developers that have nearly all the language memorized. Every framework? No of course not. But a significant portion of it that they don’t need to stop every two minutes to google something. 

You’re trying to say the 10x programmer is a myth. It’s not. 

If you had to negotiate an important peace treaty between two people who didn’t speak the same language. Would you want an interpreter who had to use Google Translate or one who had mastered both languages."
@hassantanoli9342,Just started learning coding for real 4 months ago and i always feel like im not ready to do anything. Whenever i hear about a leetcode problem I don't even understand that problem itself how would i even start to solve it I'm very bad at math also.when ever i write a piece of code thinking i will do as i think it don't usually is doesn't even run sometimes it partially work. I've seen hundreds of videos but they only tell you one thing or the right method they know sometimes it helps sometimes not so much. I'm currently learning PHP cuz the job market is not ao good at the moment but they do have some php jobs now and then backend make more sense to me sometimes others it has soo many code that just check the conditions even before using them still make sense. But I'm most exhosted by CSS you can't just learn it how am i supposed to know how much code i will be writing even before i see the actual site it's just too much and there are always more CSS to be written to make the components look better how much is enough?.
@thomaskluck4164,"Hint on naming variables: Don't choose a name by what a variable contains. This might as well mean that all your variables are called ""data"". Try to incorporate the reason why a variable holds that data: ""userInputNumber"" is way better than ""integer"" because you remember where it came from as well as where it is going to end. My 2 cents as a programmer :)"

@HampusAhlgren,"As much as I'd like #6 to be true, it's definitely not. Clients don't care about code that's very true but if you're working with other devs - they will most certainly do. The hard part of software engineering is not writing code for computers it's writing code for other devs (and yourself in the future)."

@jasongraf2143,"A very helpful video, I've been involved in programming for a few years without really concentrating on a specific direction because I just can't make up my mind, absolutely everything about development is fascinating. I'll soon be 43 and I'm really wondering whether it's worth even thinking about working as a developer one day. Besides, there is still the slowly rather big thing with AI. Who wants an inexperienced worker when you can just buy the AI and realise projects within hours? A worker who serves customers 24/7 and gets better and better at a frightening rate... may I have your opinion?

@VanGoreYT,"No idea how your video landed in my feed. I never coded a line, and most likely never will. I am a product designer and everything you said applies for life in general. No matter what you want to learn or do in life, the rules are the same! As a young guy  I moved to Italy. It was my childhood dream! I started to talk to random people, I used all 5 words I knew over and over again. I went to language school, learned more words, talked more to people and learned more every day. I made a ton of mistakes, and nobody cared! Not me, not the beautiful Italian girl at the bar… I leaned by doing it, no matter what. Whenever I am stuck, or afraid of something I try to remember that time, that sense of freedom, that eagerness to learn I felt back then. I know nothing, but one thing: if I need it, I can learn it! This lesson in life was enough to have a successful career as a designer, outperform many people with way more talent or much stricter discipline!"

@cyrex9476,"Everything is correct!!!, However, writing well-structured, clean code does matter when it comes to production. It is not about user experience; it is about developers. for example, when it comes to feature enhancement and massive datasets, it does matter."

@haxic,Spot on!
@prof_biney,This is a big gem. Even traders need to watch this too.... Serious Psychology masterclass... Thanks❤
@UmarNasimov,"1. You don't need to know everything -> It's more about understanding pattern than rememberring/learning everything (just like cooking);
2. Learn how to Learn -> Best way is writing code. Switch from consumer mode to creater mode;
3. Perfection is a Trap/Lie -> in a very relative/subjective/fast-changing world no body can write flawless/perfect code. Done is better than perfection, finished ugly code is better than perfect code that takes huge time to be finished and never leaves your laptop;
4. You will never feel ready, start anyway -> You don't need to be confident, you just need to be willing. Start Messy, Start Scary, Just Start;
5. The Real-Skill is Problem-Solving -> Start Focusing Less on 'What to write' and more on 'Why it is written that way';
6. Nobody cares about your Code, They care about what it Does -> Everyone (End-User, Client, Your Boss) wants the result but not what's happening under the hood. So, write codes that solves problems (if it's clean and elegent too - that's light over light) rather than sleeping over writing perfect code. Value is better than Vanity;
7. Burnout is Real so Protect your Energy -> Your Motivation, Desire and Want can turn into Exhaustion, Confusion, and Wandering;"
@tlys0737,"Bugs are the expected ""outputs"" of all development work. Nobody writes perfect code and if there was a perfect application without bugs, developers these days might have been jobless..."
@LumasylHere,"I've been trying to learn to code for 5 years on and off, Getting stuck in tutorial hell, this video helped a lot with how i was approaching coding, thank you!"
@ManishKumar-iq1vh,"Thats so me, thank you. 100% relatable."
@Sanji-KST,💯 Agreed
@GoodViiibe,"You Said everything. 
I had my first burn-out last year after 5 years of intense coding (including bootcamp, 3 professional app and 3 years in agency). 
I can’t remember how many nights I spent to debug without taking care of my brain and body health. One morning I was unable to code anything. I cried and I quit my job because passion disapeared totally due to my lack of energy. Batteries were down. 
One year later I finally comeback to the game after a very long rest who makes me think a lot about myself. 
I realize than I commit the 10 errors you explain in your video.
Now I take care of my self. Just focusing in problem solving and not just about coding perfectly.

One advice for all beginners. Take it Easy, mastering code is a long way. You really have to take care of yourself. Sleep well, do some sport, enjoy some precious time with Friends and family.
This is the way ❤"

I feel very exhausted about what to do. I am definitely doing something wrong, I am open to suggestions."

@Prince_of_Winterfell,All the points you made in this video would help me pull myself up by my bootstrap.
@jishnuiv79,Thanks so much
@TheJobroooo,iv started learning code recently. im learning python. what helped me understand stuff is figuring out the basics (maybe watch short tutorials or mostly visit the documentation) then trying to create something of my own. maybe a silly snake game. then adding random things to test what iv learnt. its helped me understand more about quicker problem solving
@iosifspart,Great tips! I really have the imposter syndrome because my main academic background is not software engineering. The tip I found more useful is that programming is about solving problems and not knowing everything
@appimedi9738,Bravoooo
@nancychaudhry3623,"Loved the comment about burnout.  I've also found that sometimes, when I take a break and I'm not thinking about a coding problem, the answer comes after the break when I look at the code again."
@GeorgeEpting,Right nobody cares about your work but when you create something and some else posted up your work well now we see what really happens in this place😊
@GeorgeEpting,Right about the questions but you still have to use calculation creativity 😊

@BerlinTokyo-c3d,"Perfect!! men, you said well men these are the most important mindset required in deb journey."
@YDV669,"But 20 years before you started 'coding', you actually would have known everything(or close to it) about a language. Before the Internet, you had no choice. There was no Googling basic syntax. I mean, hell, I've known companies to lock up language manuals(yes, printed ones on high quality paper and professionally produced) in cabinets like they were the crown jewels and not let anyone even touch them. That's how you knew you were a senior developer, when you didn't need the manuals 99% of the time. This led to problems, no doubt, as learning a language became a function of how good the seniors around you were, mitigated to a degree by college-level education. And yes, I've known idiots who only thought they knew everything but were in fact terrified of the language. Everybody laughed at them.

Of course, languages were simpler and didn't have a trillion libraries, but you could be what they today laughingly call Full Stack developers with a single language, one database, and whatever passed for shell scripting glue in your environment(JCL, MPE, MPEX, KORN, whatever they called scripting languages on VAX-VMS and DG Eclipse/Nova). Oh, and you probably needed to know how to control your dumb terminals for the UI(some environments abstracted this knowledge away).

This idea is that you don't need to know everything about a language is ludicrous, in my opinion. Sure, looking up libraries and how to use them is fine, I think, since nobody can possibly remember everything about so many. But basic language syntax? Nah, you'd better not be looking up Python list comprehensions if you claim to be a senior dev in that language, as an example.

One could claim that it's a different world now, and one would be correct, but that doesn't alter anything about software development."

@Ch17638,"Been coding for 20 years, every word here is true. 
Back when Java was my main source of work, I had to carry 3 big textbooks with me because where I worked access to the internet was very limited (slow and capped) and stackoverflow was 3 years in the future. Just one note , about the ""nobody cares about your code"", when working for big companies where you have skilled code reviewers , I promise they will definitely care if its sloppy and risks regression, but to his point don't over engineer, make sure your code is clean and well thought out for future maintenance; bad coding habits are way easier to shake earlier than later."

Yesterday I just learn how to use git and github, I know I don't manage everything they can offer, but I already can commit changes into a repository and pushing and pulling changes from my other computer, that way I can work in many places without being worry. This actually made me feel really proud of myself, I hadn't been working in a terminal like Git Bash before, and I couldn't beleive I understand how to navigate in that. Hearing a senior being this sincere makes it all easier, I hope and one day we may collaborate in a project, it'd be an honor for me. =D"

@kholidirfangi9346,Thank you for insight
@catchwest.combypuneetgrover,"Firstly I got inspired by your video convinced myself for continuing my work, end up bringing a beer and drinking it now, reason coz I am aware what I have to do is complex and lengthy and requires fresh mind, so starting when not completely fresh or ready works for not so complex or lengthy programming not otherwise, but then I noticed my broken tripod which I adjusted without being ready or prior knowledge without any hassle (edit- even repaired after enjoying my drink), other than that Almost everything said above related to how to work is relatable, experienced and self taught, however certain examples using comparisons with other works with programming are presented in a way by some which brings more disturbance rather than enlightenment except your video and not expecting decent charging for your work is completely unacceptable and should be changed forever, because these aren't unnecessary demands instead requirements, can't go for holidays/vaccation, or enjoy food or drinks at home, office,restraunts or bars, a comfortable owned  ride, etc with people you can enjoy company with, without earning a decent income, along with planning for future, and will obviously result in slow progress in programming and delay will increase more if this continues in future. Completely unacceptable and google or chatgpt will not help you there.. thats some facts sooner they accept sooner they will see the results, otherwise occasionaly inspired programmers like me will also make ways to be uninspired forever soon.. deserve to be wealthiest and aren't even unable to earn deserving from own income.. even laptop/mobile don't work without required charging.. so time is near even programmers won't."

@bongkem2723,"1. Search for basic stuff is ok, dont memorize, know how to ask, think through problem, stay clam when nothing works :))
2. Learn how to learn: like learning a language, dont consume but create code, 1h tuto 4h coding
3. Perfection is a lie, no body does, done is better than perfect
4. You'll never feel ready (first project/job/charge money), confidence built by doing in small steps
5. Real skill is problem solving: break down feature into smaller chunks, why sth breaks... be a detective, tracing evidence, push things around. Debug is part of the work, not failure.
6. Nobody cares about your code, only what it does. Clients don't care as long as it works.
7. Burnout is real, take breaks, have boundaries, rest, go on holidays, play game, sleep, touch grass.
My personal bonus: make it work, make it fast, make it pretty."
@ashishkumarbhati5009,The thing which hit me real hard is START ANYWAY. We keep waiting for confidence to come but it never comes and we waste a lot of time and peace. Great job done in this video. All are practical advices. Thanks a lot and keep doing this amazing work.
@noahjones5161,Just starting but it seems like there's a lot of wisdom packed in here... Not just applicable to coding but applicable to all things that appear daunting. Learning to learn and being willing to press forward without a complete and perfect understanding goes against our desire to not F stuff up or not be bad at whatever it is we're learning.

@Sattvaraj,"really great advices. im just starting my education at age 34. I want to do cybersecurity, hopefully police work. and just seeing so many stories about kids who have already passed so many certifications at only 16, done so many great hacks, it's pretty demotivating. but just as long as I focus on being able to competently do the job that's all that matters. cybersecurity really is my best option as far as I can tell right now, because I feel like you should be in a job that interests you. had a bit of a messed up life. playing catch up."
@fenfire3824,"You should care about your code. You should even consider using something like sonar qube.
The reason is maintainability. You should always us as much libraries, patterns and best practices your framework is recomending and following code standarts as much as possible.
If you start programming a lot of stuff yourself in plain code or start doing tons of workarounds, because you feel your std and framework libraries are limiting, you probably do something wrong.
It is important because you have to maintain your crappy code and you will forget what you did 2 weeks ago. Understanding old shty code or what other developers coded is causing huge headaches and is very annoying and frustrating. Especially if you have to update libraries and all your custom stuff falls apart. And you should also use as few third party libraries as possible and only use libraries, that are maintaned very well. Otherwise some crap gets abandoned and you have to implement something else from scratch. 
It is especially important because the eu created a law called digital service act which forces developers to keep their software secure. 
This is a huge thing and a big stone to overcome for beginners. 
I highly disagree, that nobody cares about your code. I strongly recommend to get a coder good enough to be able to review every commit and pair programming. 
If you dont follow it, a burnout is absolutely guaranteed and I can promise, that most people will just quit, because they cannot fix the bad code they wrote. It is the fastest way to lose a job. And also the main reason why people quit in the first place. And then you inherit some project from some coworker who quit, and you are the unlucky person who are forced to fix this crap. 
If you are a boss, this causes a chain reaction and all your coders will quit. Have fun finding new ones. Also have fun telling your customers, that you completely have to create the software again from scratch, because it is unfixable or impossible to update. This happend in our company already, it was a huge cost and you really dont want that. With the dsa you also might consider, that unhappy customers will sue you. Have fun winning on court, if you cannot document the stuff you coded. All your clever hooks are probably some fancy wannabe hacking that isnt even clever in the first place."

@thefamousdjx,"Thats even more true now with AI available to help you every step, just gotta believe in yourself and getting started anyways. I still do work for clients that I started with on my first few months of coding, adding features or tweaking stuff. The code I wrote that time was so badly structured lol but still good enough. They still rely on it to this day, runs smoothly and I'm not even going to try to clean it up since it works just fine. There is certain threshold you need to reach though to be able to be a top developer and that needs a strong passion and a relentless approach to things. If you juggling too many things in your life its going to be very hard to lock in at the required frequency. If you live in a party house forget it lol, you need quiet environments and be able to go on for days learning without anyone constantly nagging you to do something else."

When looking at huge projects that are in active development for years and years, they do eventually care when shit starts taking longer and longer to do, due to messy, difficult to understand implementation we left like that because “the customer doesn’t care about the code”.

When I spend time on naming variables properly and making code clean and readable, I’m helping my future self and other future developers that will be working on the code in years to come. I’m spending just a bit of extra time now, so that things don’t eventually grind to a halt in the future.

This is also from 15+ years working as a developer."
@SafaeSafe-n9w3q,the best vid in yt for real i really apreciate it 💓💓
@RiyadMahmud-xt2ho,Those tips are actually beneficial 😊
@ErisCyberProjects,"All the pints here were incredible. Thank you. I’m just starting out and the point that hits the hardest is that I’ll never feel ready. I always start to think in my head when will I be ready and even before this video I start to think “I will never be ready” and it’s actually good to hear that it’s the truth and it shouldn’t stop me. Thank you you’ve help a lost soul find his way. Blessings from Houston, Texas ❤"
@alfonzo6320,id disageee with number 6. if you are part of a team. you team will likely care about the code you write.. alot.. especially if they have to debug it at a later time. that will be glad you used and respected guidelines.
@shanmukhasain1334,very helpful dude 
@alschneider5420,Been programming for 40 years or more. What you say is true but why so long to get this stuff. I had no mentor. I had manuals. Gimme the manual and I can program it.
@SomtoNwali-ig4rz,"all touched me, thanks for the heads up"
@JonelKingas,"I feel like coding should be something like, you see the code and know exactly how it works and can add stuff, fix stuff etc, you think mathematically etc, for me i just cant grasp it, example for loops its very hard too understand for me"

# The Complete Guide to Coding Wisdom: Essential Lessons for Developers

*Based on insights from Pete's 13+ years of programming experience, expanded with complementary wisdom from the broader developer community.*

## Core Mindset Lessons

### 1. You Don't Need to Know Everything
**Pete's Insight:** Real developers don't memorize every detail of a programming language. Coding is about understanding patterns and knowing how to find answers (e.g., Googling solutions), not having everything in your head.

**Extended Wisdom:** Focus on fundamentals over trends. Instead of chasing every new framework or tool, prioritize mastering core concepts like data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. These fundamentals remain relevant regardless of changing technologies and provide a strong foundation for tackling any language or tool later on.

### 2. Learn How to Learn
**Pete's Insight:** Watching tutorials isn't enough; true learning happens by coding yourself. Spend more time building (4 hours for every 1 hour of tutorials) and embrace getting stuck as part of the process.

**Extended Wisdom:** Document your journey and code. Keep notes on what you're learning, challenges you face, and solutions you find. Comment your code to explain your thought process. This habit reinforces understanding and makes it easier to revisit past work or help others understand your logic.

### 3. Perfection is a Trap
**Pete's Insight:** Don't obsess over flawless code. Done is better than perfect—ship projects even if they're messy, as this accelerates learning and improvement.

**Extended Wisdom:** Iterate and refactor over time. Your first version doesn't need to be the final one. Build a working prototype, get feedback, and improve it iteratively. Refactoring (improving code without changing its behavior) is a normal part of development and helps you learn better practices as you grow.

## Action-Oriented Lessons

### 4. You Will Never Feel Ready—Start Anyway
**Pete's Insight:** Confidence comes from doing, not waiting. Start projects, apply for jobs, or take on freelance work even if you feel unprepared or face imposter syndrome.

**Extended Wisdom:** Set small, achievable goals. Break down learning and projects into manageable tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Completing small goals (like building a simple calculator before a full app) builds momentum and confidence while preventing burnout from tackling massive objectives all at once.

### 5. The Real Skill is Problem Solving
**Pete's Insight:** Coding isn't just writing syntax; it's about breaking down problems, debugging, and asking the right questions. Focus on building your thinking skills over typing speed.

**Extended Wisdom:** Adaptability is as important as technical skills. Technology evolves rapidly, and specific tools or languages may become obsolete. Cultivating a mindset of adaptability—being willing to learn new things and pivot when needed—ensures long-term success in the field, beyond just mastering current syntax or frameworks.

### 6. Nobody Cares About Your Code, They Care About What It Does
**Pete's Insight:** Clients, bosses, and users prioritize functionality over how elegant your code is. Focus on delivering results rather than perfect, unseen solutions.

**Extended Wisdom:** Balance technical and soft skills. While coding is crucial, communication, teamwork, and understanding user needs are equally important in a professional setting. Being able to explain your work, collaborate with non-technical stakeholders, and prioritize user experience often matters more than the code itself.

## Sustainability and Growth

### 7. Burnout is Real—Protect Your Energy
**Pete's Insight:** Avoid the grind mentality. Take breaks, rest, and maintain boundaries to sustain productivity. Treat your brain like a battery that needs recharging.

**Extended Wisdom:** Recognize that sustainable productivity beats unsustainable intensity. Regular breaks, proper sleep, and maintaining interests outside of coding contribute to long-term success and creativity in problem-solving.

## Additional Essential Principles

### 8. Failure is a Teacher, Not a Roadblock
Every bug or broken feature is an opportunity to understand what went wrong and how to improve. Embracing failure as feedback rather than a personal shortcoming helps build resilience and accelerates skill development. The fastest way to become a better developer is to fail fast, fail often, and learn from each experience.

### 9. Community and Collaboration are Key
You don't have to figure everything out alone. Engaging with coding communities (Stack Overflow, GitHub, Discord groups, local meetups) provides support, resources, and mentorship. Collaborating on projects or pair programming exposes you to different problem-solving approaches, enhancing your learning exponentially.

### 10. Build a Portfolio of Problems Solved, Not Just Code Written
Focus on showcasing the problems you've solved and the impact you've created, rather than just displaying lines of code. Employers and clients want to see that you can identify needs, propose solutions, and deliver value. Document the before-and-after of your projects, the challenges you overcame, and the results you achieved.

## The Developer's Practical Toolkit

### Daily Habits for Success
- **Start coding before you feel ready** - Action builds confidence faster than preparation
- **Embrace the documentation** - Reading docs is a core skill, not a weakness
- **Version control everything** - Git is your safety net and collaboration tool
- **Test as you go** - Don't leave testing for later; make it part of your development process
- **Refactor regularly** - Clean code emerges through iteration, not initial perfection

### Questions Every Developer Should Ask
- ""What problem am I actually solving?""
- ""Who is this for, and what do they need?""
- ""What's the simplest solution that could work?""
- ""How will I know if this is working correctly?""
- ""What could go wrong, and how do I handle it?""

### Signs You're Growing as a Developer
- You spend more time thinking about problems than syntax
- You're comfortable saying ""I don't know, but I can find out""
- You prioritize user needs over technical elegance
- You see bugs as puzzles rather than failures
- You actively seek feedback and collaboration
- You can explain complex concepts in simple terms

## Final Thoughts

The journey of becoming a skilled developer is not about reaching a destination where you know everything—it's about developing the confidence to tackle any problem, the humility to keep learning, and the wisdom to focus on what truly matters. Every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up.

Remember: Your code doesn't have to be perfect, but your commitment to growth should be unwavering. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can, and trust that each small step forward is building toward expertise.

The programming world needs problem solvers, not just code writers. Focus on becoming someone who can bridge the gap between complex technical solutions and real human needs—that's where the most rewarding and impactful work happens."

@multigladiator384,"3:20 First, solve the problem and with the time you will see how you could improve that code.
If you have a running business and customer requests pending there is not so much time for like perfect academic precision type sht.
people often forget, that in the real economy, time and cost are very important factors besides quality. You have to find a good spot in the mid of those three xD
Agree 100% here"
@MichaelHailu-k1t,you guy tell an important issue.That is wasting all the day in just one bug is not neccessay and the way you present the ideas were interesting kerp on bro(Ethio)
@Blissfully_Aware,"I really needed to hear this, thanks bro!"
@weacro,All of these are true and things i've come to learn now that i'm over 10 years in the field. I used to think I could never get a job as I didn't have this robust code knowledge and could make components in minutes. It hindered me from applying for jobs as I thought I was never good enough. None of that is true. No one knows everything and research is the key to this field.

@NoCastAm,Thank you so much
@sajiths3815,Excellent
@Vondrsen,"Its not about which one of these I wish were told to me earlier. With a common sense you are already aware of these. But the real thing is, you need to remind yourself these, or to be reminded of these, every once in a while. They need to be verbalized and not live inside the head. So thanks for the verbal part. It helped a lot."
@TMiTommy,I feel like all these is not just about coding its also about life. thank you so much
@lightingvulture,you don't need to know everything hits me hard as I learnt that very soon
@Priceygames,Nice but is there a ghost in 7:29?
@tanjilaislam5970,thank you so much
@yama-fanboy,"He forgot the MOST important point...
Point number 8: Either hire a chef or contract a scheduled food delivery service. I lost 10 lbs of weight and started feeling light headed during the first month of trying to develop custom software. The day and night just mush together and before you know it days can pass you without proper nutrition. If you're in this line of work a POTENT multivitamin is exactly as important as VS Code"

@paulogp4629,"Great lesson, mate. Cheers from Brasil."
@jeffreyhammack1575,the burnout comment was the ringer😅
@AndyPerry1972,"Thank you Pete!  That pretty much describes me now.  Trying to watch as many learning course videos as possible. Trying to keep up whilst I am watching and finding myself just pausing as I basically just copy type what they are doing! Giving up because I can't get something to work and thinking it needs to be perfect or struggling to get a simple control aligned in the position I want it.  Frustrated because the course I just spent hours watching didn't sink in after all.

I just started messing about and after watching this, I don't care now if it doesn't work.  Instead of giving up and deleting it, I will try to solve the issues and hopefully learn more that way."
@jasonmora4542,Thanks for this video I really needed it

@HopeFear-sx6om,The watching of tutorials and not starting is real and nice analogy comparing it to learning a language you learn by speaking not listening
@leeeju._,"As a 21yrs old that just started coding, I'm glad I saw this now. Worrying a lot and thinking how many competitions. In reality, starting will separate you from the majority."
@4KI75E4NN,"Great video, very motivating 🦾"
@HamzaIbrahim18,thank u man
@ran25257,Thanks a lot brother!  Your advice is invaluable.❤
@MDGCK,"Honestly I very rarely interact with videos on youtube, but honestly seen a lot of videos for beginners like myself. I started working 3 weeks ago and I push really hard because it's my first tech/office job. Great video best advice in this video is to pace yourself, this is not a rat race everybody will get there. Maybe you still didn't land your dream job, but that time will come, just work on it and never give up and once you do don't burn yourself out over the job. Everybody starts somewhere people weren't born senior devs."

@DaMaster1983,"The most important thing about coding is how to organize your code and how a complex project is being handled.
You need to understand the basic idea of programs.. 
and I dont see any tutorials for that..

Also todays IDE's are not so good for Coding.. as they should be"
@MikieSWE,"C'mon. Your vlog unlocks a lot. I am a 12k teacher, and you nail it to 85%. Students I teach, I tell them I'm only 95%. I tell them 5% is all on you. You still stretch this far longer. Thank you for this. Its heart warming and its so accurate. Just subbed, to be able to come back to watch this again. I will use most parts of your thinking in my classes. Man you talk wonders.

@leon4000,"All I know is that I'm ready to get back up again. I'll leave my personal details out. But I've made enough rookie mistakes that I found myself struggling with this since I graduated. Heck, right down to finding jobs I had a hard time. I ended up stuck and it went on for longer than it should. But I want to try again, and this time apply all this you've laid down. I can remember how I did one of my assignments for multidimensional array. I just need to hold on to any moment that made me realize and never neglect the things that my body needs. I'll keep this on my Things to Remember playlist. I need to grow out of this habit of mines. And perhaps this will help me a bit to face life. Thank you."

So if anyone fears, don't overthink it. Just try and be persistent, even if your self-esteem tells you the opposite, it's a matter of consistency and time."

@kofex2084,"I would be glad if you could answer me. I will be joining a company next month. The company I will be joining is a company that works on the back-end. I have a teacher who is teaching me for there. He kept telling me that I do not have the foundation and that I need to learn concepts such as functions carefully. I do not want to deal with such simple things. I have made many applications with the help of artificial intelligence such as weather application, banking application, cargo tracking system but these are not enough for him and he defines me as a failure. He does not have much hope in me either. Any advice will a gold for me."

@getupkid84,"Great advice. Everything you said is 100% spot on. I've been coding professionally for around 13 years and I still feel like a complete newbie to it. Even now, imposter syndrome is always there! 
Online tutorials always look ""perfect"". They make it seem like they know exactly what they're doing every step of the way. But what one needs to realise is that, that developer has spent hours trying to solve the problem. They've recorded hours of content but only posted the edited version. The version where one doesn't see the developer making mistakes etc. 
So yeah, give yourself a break. You're better than you think you are."

But this is the only one i heard earlier other 6 those i didn't heard it before. Thanks you so much for the real experiences and i realized those things in my internship. Really nobody cares about my code they cares about what it does as like you said. Also this burnout moment, i feel it sometimes but i didn't know they put this feeling name is burnout."

@Lucas-89-o5q,"For me after almost 15 years as a developer I have realized that I have enough of solving problems. Additionally the direction in which the industry is going results in not treating devs as normal humans but as machines that can take on everything. It became a field for people that don't need to have private life but we are humans - we need it.

@kinyemi1,Thank you for the insight
@AIdrivenabundance,Great insights! Thank you! Burnout is real and that my clients don't really care for my code are the ones that ring the bell to me. I really like the way you draw examples from real life to make your point. Is it okay if I need two weeks of vacation after solving a bug? I find it the trickiest when using libraries that do not work and then trying to fix the code to get what I need. Especially true for libraries that are maintained in voluntary basis like academia.

@shortcutelectronics,"I'm calling out #6. The other guys, who have to work with your code care. The boss can ignore that if that's a quick money grab for him and he plans to be out of business after few years because someone else can do it more efficiently. Good naming of variables and functions. Modularity. Reusability of code - in my opinion that all matters and I appreciate these things when I have to carry on someone elses work. There's a huge difference if that code is meant for one specific thing and the end device has ""unlimited"" resources or the code base is more than 10 years old with millions of lines of code meant for multiple similar platforms/devices especially with limited memory space and computing power and you ave to adapt the code every few months for new device."

@mr.bitster9628,"Everything. I wish someone had told me about everything in this video. My biggest things were not needing to know everything, never feeling ready, and burnout. I was always under the impression that all the intermediate/senior devs just know everything off the top of the dome, but it makes it feel a lot more relatable knowing that even they have to Google/get help from time to time. I'm thinking about applying for my first QA Engineer role, and while I've tested some websites and feel a little confident on some days, I still don't feel like I'm quite good enough. But you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. And burnout is 100% real, especially for the noobies like me. Taking a day or so off from programming and coming back to work on your project does wonders and can even make you surprise yourself with just how much you actually do know once you give your brain some time to rest.

1. We don't need to know everything.
2. Learn how to learn.
3. Perfection is nightmare that will make you fear everytime you are coding for something 
4. You will never feel ready.. There is no TOMMOROW! START NOW!!
5. No one cares how your code looks, they only cares about its working.
6. At some point you will suck at something. We can't able to solve a bug we try for hours.. relax take a break you will figure it out eventually.

@aaronbcarlisle,"I loved every minute of this video — it had me smiling from ear to ear the whole time. I've been working in game development for over a decade now, and everything you covered was spot on.

I remember a physics engineer once told me early in my career: ""All code is shit.""
Something about the way he said it really stuck with me. It was like the weight of years of imposter syndrome and self-doubt suddenly got lighter. My whole perspective on programming shifted in that moment. The piles of what I used to see as tech debt — or now ""legacy"" code — that I was once ashamed of didn’t feel so bad anymore.

Much love!"
@Glaze_RedEye,I just graduated a full stack coding boot camp. I feel as if the job market is flooded with people looking for these jobs especially since they are remote. Also AI possibly taking jobs away from coders... what is your perspective? I dont really feel confident at all in this. It was alot to learn in 6 months

I've been contemplating especially during my coding hours like what if our instructor would look at the code and ask me about it. Or what if they would look at it and check if we really applied what we learned during their lectures.😢 Well guess what?! None of it matters at all. Not everything they teach us at school is complete, most of it requires us to learn by ourselves. They don't teach us everything, they want us to explore.😊"

@GnDNights,"@webdevelopete Congratulations on the video! Honestly, it was straight to the point. I've been teaching programming since around 2003. You might be the first person I’ve heard who really understands what programming is really about,  just like you explained in the video.

When I train people, either junior devs or professionals,  I always ask them one simple question:
‘How long would it take you to read a 1000-page book?’
Most of them say, ‘3 to 4 weeks.’

But I tell them the correct answer is: 3 minutes -  just by reading the table of contents.

You don’t need to memorize the whole book.
What matters is knowing what’s inside the book and where to find it. That way, when you need something, you know which book has the answer and you can go straight to it.

Once again, great job on the video!"

My thoughts always pushed me back to start coding, i always thinked i have to learn the full langyage first the i should start it, which is a very bad misonception. not only that , most of the lines you told is  related to me. now i will really gonna start my journy, even though i feel Unconfident. Thnkyou So much"

@Dhaneshwaran-z2g,Coding is not about just typing it's solving problems
@crispindeleon1930,start anyway! brother that hit hard!
@Balajiice,Perfection matter if it's a team project
@peterkolawole8965,Wow it's was as if you were talking directly to me you have my follow thank you.
@GamerBroAdalian,"There's always someone who's better at writing code than you. But no matter what, keep writing. You'll naturally develop more techniques for ""optimal"", ""mature"", and ""cleaner"" code over time. I spent a whole year thinking my knowledge wasn't good enough to work on a project, until today I refactored it, and now I feel the creative juices flowing again."

@coreragestudios3430,"Grass is Overrated, Touch Rocks!"
@cocomj123,"Yes. My opinion is to have an overview of the project and start up. Make adjustment in between to make things better.

However, in workplace, management want the best/perfection project and staff get blame if something that error. It is the most stressful thing"
@adrianoholmes635,"Great video.
Just go ahead and build. Things don't have to be perfect, and just learn on the fly. 
Great advice."

@hacker1-i3z9j,thanks bro
@divyanshu8874,Brother today i was about to give up coding.. i built an api the output is correct. But went timeout in client environment as client had 5000+ entities and i had to generate 5000 equivalent objects to produce an excel with 5000 rows. Code works okay for 200 300 even 400 but certainly not for 5000 also i cant use too many threads as client heap space is limited. I was asked to leave the team. And as you said nobody gives a fuck about the code everyone cares about the output. My team is treating me like i an an idiot i am not given any work they forgot the huge proxy issues i solved in their project i dont feel like going to work and here at house i am able to solve leetcode medium level questions.

@hopeziontekilu6537,bro thanks like you said burn outt is real I thought I would became productive  by spending tons of hours with out enjoyment but it really sucks I lost myself in the journey so to become productive we need to have rest and enjoyment
@georgevendras5450,"The best advice I would like to receive is: STAY AWAY FROM DEV. IT IS A KNOWLEDGE BARREL WITHOUT END. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND YOUR SOUL SO UNJUSTLY.

If I were really great at RestAPI and in backend dev in general (of by heart, no goggling_every_10_minutes crap ), I would ask no less than 150k and perhaps 200k."
@martysomoco,Excellent and concise advice. Thank you.
@youtubechannelthejigsaw6802,Man thanks for speaking up. I am a beginner and I think I got all the necessary things that I have to understand. Only if you mention..In which order I have to start practicing. I mean which programming language I have to learn first and then next and next. And yeah thanks for speaking up!

@VoidGamer09,"I need to ask a question
Is creating projects with AI a good practice because i am definately learning and debugging but however it generates the code sometimes, so is that  bad way of doing it.🥲"
@abdulazeezabdulmujeeb4739,Focus on building product that everyone sees not the perfection code you only see 🥹🫶
@Sajal-Paul,"Thanks Sir, you have given an honest and precise advice to all coders"
@ediare1,Word !
@ED-Leach,"You don’t need to know everything – Good developers don’t memorize everything; they know how to find answers and spot patterns.

Learn how to learn – Watching tutorials isn’t enough; real progress comes from building your own projects, failing, and Googling your way through it.

Perfection is a trap – Spending hours on perfect names or clean code wastes time. Done is better than perfect.

You’ll never feel ready – Whether it’s applying for jobs or starting a project, confidence comes after you start, not before.

Coding is about problem solving – Syntax is secondary. The real job is debugging, thinking critically, and breaking down problems.

Nobody cares how clever your code is – What matters is that it works and solves the user’s problem. Clean code is a bonus, not the goal.

Burnout is real – Constant grinding leads to exhaustion. Sustainable progress means taking breaks, setting boundaries, and prioritizing health.

Practice over consumption – Follow the 1:4 rule: For every hour watching tutorials, spend at least four building without them.

Messy starts are necessary – Beginners often wait for the “right time” to build or apply. Instead, start messy, start scared—just start.

Value over vanity – Don’t chase elegant abstractions if they don’t add real value. Clients care about results, not clever code."

@AliAli-z3l1k,Thank you ❤
@gavinlim3143,"I disagree with your first point. Although anything can be googled, how productive can you be as a developer? The more you know, the faster you can code, the more productive you will be."
@calebfurley3784,"I'd like to add, don't be afraid of the console. Try virtualbox with linux. <- This will teach you how the computer works, so that way when you write code, you understand what it is really doing."
@jojojojojojojo2,"13 years means you just came out of Junior dev level. I can tell you that guys with 30+ years experience out there have all the code memorized. They can write code without having to look up anything. 5k lines of code till lunch break? Yep, that is possible. And I am not talking about skeleton code. I mean real 5k LLOC - a whole business application in 3 hours. And it looks like you will never get there because you gave up."

@abadmohamed8347,"hey, thanks  for sharing this, but now i think it's outdated, AI now is your main companion, i stoped developing when i paid openai subscription, i mean don't get me wrong, you should have the knowlegde, but you don't should spend time coding functionnalities, the AI will do it for you, tell him what your inputs are, what should the function do and voila, you have a good written code, sometimes it doesn't work as expected, that's normal, you just identify what doesn't work, and he will rectify it for you."

@osamaxz5720,"thank god. Your video just in time thanks man. I need this advices really
I'm studying Information Technology Engineering and specialized in Intelligent Systems (AI) but I start my journey learning web development about 2 years ago and learnt frontend and many things and I made many projects. I've been looking for a job from 6 months till now I got an interview with rejection in the end of it so I thought I know nothing really and said to myself I need to learn more before apply to a job. so I start pushing hard and switched to full stack so started focusing in backend development and working in a website for articles (something like Medium but more customized) and really I've been thinking of chose the perfect code and that's really HARD to figure out what is the best and when I post a question in stack overflow  I get this answer (there is no wrong or correct it depends) thanks man that remind me of I shouldn't make it perfect and I will start applying for jobs tomorrow and I will just make my app working now ❤"

@romantarnai4702,"I went through burnout couple of months ago in my 20s. I was working 24/7 trying not to waste a signle minute of my time and be super productive. I thought burnout is just some stupid excuse of lazy programmers - spoiler it is not. After 1-2 months of low energy, bad mood etc. I stopped working so hard, I learned to give myself some breathing room and it got better. Now I don't rush things it's not like all the job opportunities will be long gone if I don't have 10+ years of experience as I finish university."

@HLS6935,"Been a developer for over thirteen years and always tell junior devs that are assigned to me, not to build a polished product from the start, rather get the product working and then go back and refactor and cut out the fat.  Also, management is typically non-technical and will always over simplify what you do and think things should be completed days before you can actually get it done."
@Adiyen1974,Great Insights. Thanks for Sharing.
@Marz3nith,"I love this because I apply that same fear to every aspect. Anything technical but new. I felt this way when I was coming off of supporting Windows, to jumping in and supporting Linux. I tried to have every single eventuality memorized. How to fix broken packages, how to manage processes, does Linux have device manager? Where does Linux store driver filed? Do they have equivalents to inf files? Do you sometimes have to replace them too? Is there an equivalent to registering dlls exist in Linux? Speaking of registering, is there a system registry? I'm always having to do things in that for Windows... Basically?  Anything I could imagine going wrong on Windows I had to know if there was a Linux equivalent fix. Most of these things I still haven't had to do or know lol ...And the simple reason is because Windows and Linux don't share every common issue. In fact very few. Linux is a fairly rock solid OS and Windows has all the problems lol"

@moinulfaisal,"Magically, I am naturally avoiding all the possibilities of traps pointed out in this video as a self-taught developer.
I don't seek perfection.
I dont burn out my energy.
Try to kick it off right away when I feel this is the time for start.
Don't care how elegant, or perfect the code is.
Don't need to know everything. It's impossible. Instead try to get along with the basics which are used regularly."

Many colleges dont even get the willingness to understand you whats going on, they will simply ghost you. Many times i doubted if i did the right choice or not and in the end i would say yes, ur totally right, and the other that have that imposter sindrom are totally okay and yes we are not AI that will know EVERYTHING about coding, tools, methods a.s.o.

@aliazizi-ty5pw,"i know many programming languages but i couldnt build a full app that was not cause i didnt know the code or how to solve problems, that was because making a big picture of the code is really important and you didnt mention it. when you wanna make instagram for example ,you have to know what are you going to build and what details you exactly need (buttons, links , nodes , correct database schema, correct UI and... ) and how small details must be connected to each other . i always write down the big pictures on a paper or draw it on visio or stuff like that and then i start building step by step a single part of it and make it work.in this was you have clue to make what pieces and that piece is going to be used again or not , you need to dive deeper in the code for making it more advanced or it is just a single piece that is used once and no need to waste time on it at all.
i think every single piece you said was 100% correct and i just want to add

@DizzyQuanto,"You’ll never feel ready, learn how to learn, and You don’t need to know everything. I’m currently learning how to code through the Godot game engine using their GD Script. I learned a little bit of code over 10 years ago, but outside of that and the reminders over the years (code really sticks out when you’ve learned it 😅) I have never made a fully functional website, let alone a fully operational video game. 
Hearing that it’s ok to search things up, and that I should practice what I learn and take time to “speak the language” rather than just following all of the tutorials step by step is great advice! I’ve recently fallen into a pit where I watch a tutorial and use it to code my game with small edits. I want to change my approach so I can at least feel comfortable problem solving.
I hope to continue growing and some day see people enjoy the games I make 😊 thank you for this video!"

@NaimurRahmanNiloy-l6f,Thank you so much. Your words are very true. I have lost my learning path 1 year ago thinking that we developers know everything but today i changed my mind. If any suggestion that how could i revise my learning again how can i start coding again. Just give some suggestions to me please...
@Dynamic1852,Love this Video
@katongoleisaac2007,Perfection is the enemy for good
@shoarmik6389,"Disagree with the ""Nobody cares about your code"". Mainly because:
- If business wants changes it's often way harder to apply them on a dirty code
- If you're gone or on holidays the rest of the team will struggle to maintain your code
- Dirty code scare off other devs to stay in such a project
- If it's not maintained properly (and you're gone) it may require total rewrite

Clients and stakeholders care about it, they just don't know they care, because they don't understand how important it is to maintain a proper code.

And your analogy to plumbing is also very inaccurate. Plumbing is just like fixing a bug on an existing code and you want this code to be clean, otherwise by fixing it you may end up opening another bug easily, so I'd more compare clean code to good quality pipes. You can either buy cheapest pipes that will require fixing again soon or happen to be unmaintainable OR you can invest on better quality pipes which will serve you without issues for longer."

In my experience, I have an opinion about: ""Nobody cares how clever your code is, just that it works"". 
I agree, the code has to work first, but after that, it also should be clean (That's why we have Clean Code from Uncle Bob)
If we work solo on a project, that's fine, but if we work in a team, your teammate will care about it, especially if the team has a technical lead."

@andrewgr144,"I'm replying so late that I have no hope that anyone will ever actually read this, but nonetheless:

An example of ""Problem Solving is the Real Skill"" is from my 22+ year career at Microsoft.  I had stretches of time where I felt like I was stealing a paycheck, and I had stretches of time where I felt like I was saving the world.  But objectively the single largest contribution I ever made, in terms of money, was by *not* implementing a feature that had been assigned to me.  Rather, I asked some questions that led to getting at the actual problem the PMs were trying to solve, was able to explain why their approach wouldn't work, and offered a good alternative solution.  Due to several factors, I feel pretty comfortable saying that by *not* coding the design I was given, I saved the company multiple millions of dollars.  That experience made a deep impression on me, and I've tried to pass that knowledge along to junior developers over the years, though I'm not sure how much success I've had; it seems that most of us have a puzzlingly difficult time learning from the experience of others, and must often make the same mistakes to learn the same lessons."

@dhruvsingla2212,"One thing I would like to add is to define what is your problem, whether you are facing a bug (in which case it is obvious), trying to set up or learning something. Sometimes looking for an answer I randomly start searching things without my goal (the problem) in the back of my head. What happens, is that I find a lot of related things but none answering my problem exactly. One way to achieve this would be to stop in-between, collect what is learned uptil now and then redefine your problem statement."

@digitalbeatjunkie,"This is PRICELESS! Been learning to code for about 18 months, im guilty of all the things mentioned here, esp burnout. I was working full time, studying 20 hours a week on top of family life, it was grim, but now i have reduced the intensity of my studying, def enjoy it more now!"
@IsmailAhmadi-xr3ex,That's great to know! It can really save me from wasting time and being too hard on myself.
@thomaswinterburn6680,"I don't agree with the first point.

Programming is a sanctuary for the high-IQ individual.
A super-intelligent individual does not inherit an automatic guarantee to wealth. Programming is a way to actually compete in the marketplace by leveraging intellect. Sub-130 IQ people can make an income using programming due to the massive demand, but there are levels to this.

Look at chess, the grandmasters make up a small percentage of all chess players with abilities many orders of magnitude greater than a player who has been at it for decades, all they do is chess, and in some cases 9 year olds can beat them 25/0 games. 
Most companies have a talent gap, not a dev shortage and they optimise for the wrong things silly degrees, diluted experience, instead of demonstrable brilliance, which kinda means not only do you know all of JS like the back of your hand but you often can predict features the mud monkeys will implement in the next js version controll.  
That's the truth."
@natzdavid3666,"Actually needed these. A year has gone by after my graduation and still haven't been hired yet.

@alexandrumacovei4534,"I've been learning coding for about 5 years now. Started with python for a year, abandoned the idea, cause of job prospects. Then after a year I wasted another 2 years to learn JavaScript, again impostor syndrome. now after 2 years I'm in my last chapter on Java (udemy course most popular one) The problem with the course is that it covers everything even for advanced coders(those who are coding for a living for atleast 5 years) and the course instructor also gives extremly complicated examples on easy subjects. Anyway, it was a nightmare to follow the course, because as you said in the beginning of the video, I tend to learn everything, to memorize everything. It's a nightmare. Now im trying to finish the chapter of jdbc connectivity,statement etc. your videos is a motivational video for me"

@botondkalocsai5322,"The ""nobody care about your code"" is a very dangerous attitude in companies that can ruin even midterm maintenance, though gives job security to the dev.

This basically incentivise writing spaghetti code that only its author can somewhat maintain.

Companies tend not to care about the code, hence coorporate code bases are ugly messes, that always barely working.

There are those engineers that are so good that they can be fired from the company because their code can be maintained just fine. There those are engineers that are so bad, that they cannot be fired because their code is a barely working mess, and they are the only ones that can keep the code alive somewhat."

@gideonokyere1516,All of what you mention
@ssv8364,Good advice but it's sad that shipping quickly is overtaking quality. Software is sh*tty but users have gotten used to it so it doesn't really matter. All that matters is that we ship ASAP to feed consumerism's hunger. I've worked on projects where devs push something that barely works (and they know it) just to make it look like some progress. Because there are deadlines that nobody understands why... The whole world is in a hurry.
@gogic37,"Exactly. I released my first app on Google Play and I never believed I would succeed. My knowledge was basic. I didn't know anything about Android Studio or Flutter, but after three months I managed to finalize the app. I even managed to do what no one else had. I connected Android to external devices and everything started working. I believe in your success too because only with that kind of thinking can a programmer succeed. Good luck"
@ukraineSpaceman,Дуже гарне відео. Дякую. Погоджуюсь з Вашим кожним словом.
@lammmmdouye,those advices are not only applicable in coding. it is a life lesson.
@ndenkha,"I agree with most of what you say except the ""no body cares about your code"" part. While true the customers don't care because they'll never deal with the code, but your manager, teammates, and company care a lot, and if the code is not good quality code then that's a maintenance nightmare and costly to the company and eventually you'll get yourself fired for piling up code debt. It's as simple as, Bad Code = Wrong Code."

@generessler6282,"I agree with nearly all of this. But, sorry. ""Nobody cares about your code"" can only be true if 1) you're the only programmer in the system you're working on and 2) you are willing to suffer with re-learning your own flaws when you eventually return to them, needing to fix or modify. Code is written once and usually read many times by many people. Code that others can read and understand easily is important and kind to them, worth striving for. A more negative way of putting it is that you're ""that guy"" on the team who pushes messy, poorly structured code, it probably won't end well for you."

@luuzidai_googleplay,I started making apps last year and honestly its saving me. I am 44 yrs old and my health isn't the best but the genuine love I have for development is helping me keep going.
@LadyAmandaK,"Perfection  -- something that is almost impossible to overcome in a perfectionist who spends their entire life trying to do everything the best they can, often wasting time and doing everything to avoid making any mistakes. Having a good understanding of programming, perfectionism can unfortunately completely block the development of programming skills."
@RyzerX-Gaming,"I am on my way to becoming a full-stack web developer. I genuinely enjoy coding—especially solving problems and making things work. As a self-taught developer, my main goal is to learn by doing. So far, I’ve built over 15 frontend projects. Every time I learn something new, I immediately try to apply it by building.

However, the hardest part of this journey is battling the fear in my own mind. After weeks or months of learning, doubts sometimes creep in. I start to wonder whether I will ever truly stand out in this field. But then, my inner voice reminds me: this is my passion. I’m not doing it to prove anything to others—I’m doing it because I love it.

I genuinely wish myself the best as I continue this journey."
@ZajdoSmurf,"""i ones spend an entire weekend to fix a bug""? my friend if you didnt actualy been stuck for atleast 2 weeks in those 12 years you are lying . my cooworker who worked 20years with master degree was stuck 1 month in a bug . and you only was stuck for the weekend xD imposible ."

@SylvainLTran,"most of these applies to me too. I've been coding professionally for only 2 years and a half or so for a big tech company, and I wonder if I'm going to be able to spend the rest of my life doing it. It's nice to point out that the solution to a lot of these points is to be humble. I've noticed a lot of successful seniors are pretty humble. Pride blocks self-improvement."

@theonegatoo,"Perfectionism isn't a great trait to have because you will constantly try to modify and improve. Kind of like your first time having sex, it might be awkward, you are more focused on trying to have ""sex"" instead of enjoying the physical act itself. Apply this to programming, stop trying to find the perfect framework, writing the most perfect code. Just start doing it and stop building obstacles."

@littlegirllost2654,"10 years ago I got a BS in IT. I had a great paying job but it required no skill and I couldn’t stand it.  I loved to design so I took Web development back and front end. I never could find a job that paid close to what I was making so I figured I’d wait until I retired. For the last 4 years I stopped learning about software development. Now, I’m retired and I have to go back and learn a whole lot 😂"

@LLu-picopickle,"I completely agree with your view that perfectionism can be misleading. I recently began an internship at a startup, where I’m bombarded with new concepts like Docker, Kubernetes, and various VM providers. There’s a ton to learn, and I used to obsess over understanding every detail of a concept. However, my colleagues and supervisor keep advising me to focus on getting things working first before worrying about refining or optimizing. As an intern, I’m not expected to know every intricate detail. It’s more important to grasp how everything connects to make the program function, then later dive into techniques for improving performance or gaining a deeper understanding of the tools I’m using. This approach is a stark contrast to the learning experience in school."

@rizkihidayatcom,"Indonesian Version Ringkasan Video: 10 Hal yang Saya Harap Diberitahu Saat Mulai Coding

Dalam video ini, Pete, seorang programmer profesional dengan pengalaman 13 tahun, membagikan 10 pelajaran penting yang dia pelajari selama bertahun-tahun belajar coding. Video ini sangat membantu bagi pemula yang merasa stuck, kewalahan, atau meragukan diri sendiri.


1. Kamu Tidak Perlu Tahu Segalanya

- Banyak pemula merasa harus menghafal semua bahasa pemrograman, tapi kenyataannya tidak ada developer yang tahu semuanya.  
- Yang penting adalah memahami pola dan cara mencari solusi ketika menghadapi masalah.  
- Menggunakan Google untuk mencari jawaban itu normal dan bagian dari proses belajar.

2. Belajar Cara Belajar Coding

- Banyak yang menghabiskan waktu menonton tutorial tapi sulit membangun proyek sendiri.  
- Coding seperti belajar bahasa: kamu harus praktik, bukan hanya menonton.  
- Aturan: untuk setiap 1 jam menonton tutorial, habiskan 4 jam membangun proyek sendiri walau hasilnya belum sempurna.

3. Jangan Terjebak pada Kesempurnaan

- Perfeksionisme bisa menghambat kemajuan.  
- Tidak ada kode yang benar-benar sempurna, bahkan developer senior pun mengalami bug.  
- ""Done is better than perfect."" Kode yang berhasil dijalankan lebih berharga daripada kode yang dipoles tapi tidak selesai.

4. Kamu Tidak Akan Pernah Merasa Siap

- Rasa siap itu jarang datang, bahkan setelah bertahun-tahun pengalaman.  
- Mulailah meskipun terasa takut dan belum percaya diri.  
- Kepercayaan datang dari pengalaman dan praktik langsung.

5. Coding Itu tentang Memecahkan Masalah

- Skill utama bukan sekadar menulis kode, tapi memecahkan masalah secara sistematis.  
- Developer adalah seperti detektif yang mencari tahu penyebab masalah dan menemukan solusi.  
- Fokuslah mengembangkan kemampuan berpikir kritis dan analisis.

6. Orang Tidak Peduli Seberapa Rapi Kodenya

- Klien atau pengguna tidak peduli dengan keindahan kode, mereka peduli apakah aplikasi berjalan dengan baik.  
- Kode harus fungsional dan menyelesaikan masalah terlebih dahulu.  
- Kode yang bersih lebih baik, tapi jangan sampai mengorbankan hasil akhir.

7. Burnout Itu Nyata

- Burnout adalah masalah serius bagi programmer pemula maupun profesional.  
- Produktivitas bukan berarti bekerja tanpa henti, tapi bagaimana menjaga keberlanjutan kerja.  
- Istirahat, tidur cukup, dan melakukan aktivitas di luar coding sangat penting untuk kesehatan otak.


Kesimpulan Cepat

- Kamu tidak perlu tahu segalanya.  
- Belajar cara belajar coding dan praktek lebih banyak daripada hanya menonton tutorial.  
- Jangan terjebak pada kesempurnaan, segera kerjakan dan selesaikan proyekmu.  
- Mulai meski belum merasa siap.  
- Coding adalah soal problem solving, bukan sekadar mengetik kode.  
- Fokus pada hasil yang bekerja, bukan hanya kode yang rapi.  
- Jaga kesehatan mental dan hindari burnout.


Pesan Akhir dari Pete

Mulailah coding sekarang juga, jangan takut gagal atau tidak sempurna. Bagikan pengalamanmu di komentar dan saling membantu agar perjalanan belajar coding menjadi lebih mudah.


Semoga ringkasan ini membantu kamu memahami poin-poin penting dari video tentang tips belajar coding dari pengalaman seorang programmer profesional!"
@adamrushford,Everything he said is accurate
@شوكليتة,Thanks man I really appreciat it
@chimenemokandu3791,Amazing insights ❤
@gujo2345,ALL the Points are EQUALLY VALID
@gujo2345,E X C E L L E N T !
@IamK-d3h,A good video ❤
@yo1414,Very good video - you are right on - PROBLEM SOLVER!
@rh71el2,Dev for 25 years now and what was stated is 95% true.  Good breakdown and analogies.  The part about never feeling ready is right - but you also have to get a bit lucky that an employer will take a chance on you over someone who seems like they already know everything.  You will have to project a lot of confidence in showing you know how to solve problems and have dealt with similar before.  Show them - so you have to have the experience even if it was a practice sample at home.
@luislixo,"May a couple of && or two should be addedd. This is, now one cares about your code if it does what is needed AND is easy to readn AND to maintain."
@RiseBeat20,thanks a lot. I really wish I had known this sooner.
@vikashpunia,I wish someone had told me that at the start of my career.
@joeldelrosario3658,"Everything he said happned to me. The only difference, I always give up when faced with challenge about 99% of the time. So, I never progressed as a ""developer"".  Wish I watched this 10 years earlier."
@violet69967,"Thank you so much for this video. The timing is impeccable. I've been a dev for 6 years but I've been stuck in paralysis on my personal projects because I lost the basics.

Edit: Oh and uh, yeah I wish someone told me all of them earlier 😂. I pretty much did everything wrong"
@kreativmonky,"Learning to have a break was hard for me in the beginning! Home Office and to full fill my 8h worktime was a challange i've hardly learned to have breaks all ofer the workday and not only for getting lunch. The micro pause to stay up, walk throw the kitchen, get a short coffee break and come back to your work will improve your productivity a lot. That was one of the first lesseons i've learned and is one of the most impotent i think."
@SXsoft99,"I have reached the moment at my job where because of my boss is being chaotic i need to change my job again and that's OK. This is advice from my experience, when things start to stink maybe you need to change jobs.
To motivate my decision on my bosses actions:
- he is non-technic yet he bugs in the technical area
- he wants things done yet he doesn't want to spend at lest 30-60 minutes to define the business flow, write it on paper, he is like ""I want it like those sites have it"" and yes hes definition of the same differs from what the dev team understands
- he approves a certain way to implement things yet 5-6 months later he's like ""why did you take this decision?"" (it's my job to do it)
- he wants things go fast yet he gave me access to the ""staging"" server after I bugged him 7 months, meanwhile i had to wait for a things i could do in 1min to ask the people that had access to the server and they responded in days even if they worked internally 
My personal reasons include:
- i am having problems decoupling my personal time from work (not thinking about work)
- i net called after hours
- i can not set estimates for my work because of sometimes daily tasks changes because of everything is urgent 
- my decisions get questioned too often and i feel like i don't get respect for them
- my work has not gotten in production even if i worked for 1.5 years because of others not having time to test, approve, define flows, etc
- i am getting burned-out.....AGAIN by bad management"
@FelipeNiclvs.,"got me on all of these, i dropped out but i'm still interested and want to do things in this field, i thought i would completely go in a different direction but here i am again about to publish a website."
@Mr_Brian,Thank you for dropping this video. I feel like you are talking to me. I struggle with JavaScript because of some(if not all) of the things you said. Im glad I watched.
@RicardoAmaro123,"I am doing code since 1993 and yes you are 100% right! I stop codding for many years due to career shift as Project Manager, but now I started my own business and I am starting all over again because things changed and typing and debugging is the rule!"
@jaydenritchie1992,Remember software is great if it has the hardware correct. Also remember if you have different power sources aka 2 (or more) 12volt batteries you can have 2 separate 12volt circuits on the same wire you may want to bring data to the ic with one and then the remaining data is taken to the ram before it is grounded/earthed/negative. This is why pc have a bios battery its a seperate circuit
@ramtinkhorshidi,thank you for recording this video.
@BillyyLoomiss,"Nobody Cares About Your Code, They Care About What It Does"" i must say this is the MAIN about programming.The most important thing is the CLIENT! He wants the system or the app he does not give a damn if you will build it with Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, C. He wants the system you should be focus on build it and not on the tools to do it."

@dijc,what a video. thanks alot
@avilevin23,Great video thank you!
@trader9559,"sometimes, I feel like I am fked up because of the coding day and night. I coded more than 16 hours per day multiple projects running at the same time and switching between them. When I started the inital 3 years were the best of my years in coding. Solving problems creating amazing css animations and stunning UI. But I feel burnout a lot of times. Even now I code 12 hours per day minimum but I take breaks. I still get stuck into some bugs that make me feel sick and even If I am burning in fever I still code. honestly when I make something and thats serving a great purpose like solving a problem for people I love to coding. But later in my career I feel burnouts a lot of times still now. But I just try taking breaks within my day."

@Cubrooski,"It was all of them. The one that stuck out the most was ""You don't need to know everything"" that hit hard. I guess I just pictured programmers having the language committed to memory. Then I think about my job. I've been doing it for 30 years and I still have to look up some things. Thank you for this. I'm just starting my journey, my goal is to create an app that will help me in my job."
@JonathanBanda-t1u,"I wish someone had told me earlier that perfection is a lie and that nobody really cares about your code - they care about what it does. For so long, I’ve been trying to make every piece of code I write perfect, just to impress whoever might read it."

@danengl6056,"""burn out is real"" this hits me hard, after a tireless week with no sleep, i just want to rest for a month. i'm still a student btw."
@victoroluwatobi1531,"Productivity isn't about burnout, it's about sustainability ❤❤"
@sziklamester,"I am following some tutorials but barely finishing them. I tried Godot and still wish to use it to make games but I am more of an artistic person than a coder. Regardless I managed to copy some code and try to understand what it does but I am definitely not a coder who does code automatic mode and do it without any scheme. 

I would say I am very very beginner level at it but at least I can script and mod some video games where the code is accessible and not requires too much tools (my beloved notepad++).

The hints are good and one of the most important you said in the video is learn how to learn, because in school regardless of what kind of school you were in you never ever learn how to learn but learn tons of informations which ultimately not helps you. Not even prepare yourself for the life what that part helps a lot you do not need to know everything (also not possible).

The rest of the things also important because sometimes I have low mood to do something and have general issues, heachace etc to do something productive.

The nobody cares about your code is resonates as well because I like to draw and no matter how nice lines I try to make and how complex I try to draw if not eye catchy then people just tend to say nice try but not good enough. Always there is the feeling your drawing not perfect and often you start over. Seeking the perfection is a thing what hard to avoid because in some places people wants perfection but you cannot achieve."
@DavidGouge,"""Perfection is a trap"" and ""You'll never feel ready"" are perfect and can be applied to so many things, not just Software dev.

""Nobody cares about your code"" for me is a little bit more of a grey area.  Correct, ""working"" is best, but leave a mess (even a working mess) in the code and the next dev to come along to fix a bug or add a feature will hate you.  This then costs more to maintain in time and money.  Like the plumber example: Yes, the end use just wants the tap to work, but if the plumbing is a mess then when the user wants something changed, the next plumber will curse the original one and charge more. 😜"
@BruhDOTkam,I love these kinds of videoes. Too tired to explain why. Just know that I love them for now. Maybe I explained why later.

@nazmulislam-j1r,Thank You.
@walayat_khan,"All of these tips are 100% real and truly helpful. I honestly wish I had understood them at the start of my coding journey. Watching your video made one thing crystal clear to me: ""Perfection is a trap."" Thanks for sharing such valuable advice!"
@MVZTANG,"I stongly disagree with ""nobody cares about your code"". Everybody who has to maintain your code later on will care a lot about your code! Learn how to write clean code is essential and also important like learning new frameworks."
@blegh4886,You are spitting so many truths! Hear hear. Great advice on all counts imho.
@CyronyX,dont wast time on choosing perfect variable name.  😂😂
@GZ7BaeGiJbo8,"""Nobody cares about your code"" — this is a lesson I’ve learned after working in software development for over a decade. I used to chase technical perfection, but eventually realized that being impressed with my own code doesn’t create real value. The value of code isn’t in how complete the architecture is or how strictly design patterns are followed — it’s in whether it delivers business value."
@bogdan.todor87,"all of them helped, thank you so much!"
@Ragnarksz,"Best motivational video I have seen.  I could not agree more. Not ready for applying a job, wanting to write perfect code, is coding for me?  Spending hours on a problem and next day fix in 2 minutes. → Resting is so important.  I agree everyting you say in the video. Many thanks and you motivated me to keep going! Thank you!"
@DarkExhibitX111,important stuff . . . nobody will tell you this . . . thanks . . .
@oostaad,"I've no idea how this video pop-up on my Youtube feed. But it literally 100% built for me, felt like dedicated video for me, lol. 

I suffer from being perfect, which ultimately wasted my time & made me slow. I used to think i need to know everything, or i might get kicked out of job interview before actually doing the job. 


Got good realistic motivation from this video, hopefully time to restart & actually do it."
@TheGreatGambini,Hands down the best video I’ve seen. Every single point is just 💯
@justachipofftheiceberg6313,"One time I made a Minecraft style hotbar esculsuivly from if statements, every possible outcome for every item was hard coded..

@samuelola6432,you right  ✅️
@Bezimienny97,I am so glad that I've found this video. I am a software engineer with over 7 years of experience and the first point helped me a lot. I felt so bad for not remembering how to do things I thought I should remember. Great content!
@Mr2t2b,These tips applies not only for coding but for almost anything in life
@ml1507,Thank you for your advice. I am new to the coding. I am following the tutorial and got stuck somewhere and now I don't want to see the answer and try to resolve it myself. I can't. what would be your advice at my situation?
@Elilmu_Nur,"I'm sorry man but it's weird to take you 10+ years to learn this!? What were you doing?
And the ""Perfection is a lie"" point is true but it's not in the way you explained it at all and I'm afraid it will take you 10+ more years to realize the right thing!"
@pratikshalihinar8824,It feels like you speak for me it’s my honest feelings so far just i don’t know how to express it Thanks
@kukulis100,"I agree about all 7 hints, but its too late for me :D. I found all these by myself, and burned these 10+ years :D"
@Learninza,"The thing is, beautiful codes don't matter unless they solve the purpose is damn true. Once you've made it work, you can beautify it. Be a pro friend. Stars are twinkling."
@NafeoJoy,Man! Just use AI assistance with proper context.
@fadifadi-ie3bx,Thanks for the value. That was amazing! Perfection is a lie.
@r_Abdullah99,Every words matter. Big thanks for sharing. 🔥
@DevbhoomiFarmsCodingSchool,Can relate 100% 😅😅
@sveneFX,"After 10 years of coding experience I can only completely agree to everything that is said here. I can also say to every beginner: If I would hire a Junior, I would ALWAYS hire a person who does not know anything but is extremely motivated and kind over someone with more experience but does not seem to be much motivated."
@Slimelover24.7,"Nice summary! That ""nobody cares about your code"" might be too strong though; I see your point is to have the right priority, but that title somehow obscures the main message."
@Roald94,my best breakthrough skill i learned was knowing how to read a stacktrace in order to chase an error. learning how to debug saved so many headaches over the years and got me to where i am today.

@MrOnalata,"Sorry for my poor english, but ""the client doesn't care about the quality of your code/inside job"" was the motivation that i quit my career in graphic design and migrate to the development field, and now this sentence makes me feel super comfortable because i can work without the feeling that my code doesn't look pretty or super clean...

@mestereala,As a software architect I can say these are great advices for becomimg a good mid level developer but if you end up having this mentality  you will never evolve to be an architect. Passion leads to useless experiments and this is fine. That is the thing that you need to become great. Nothing is a waste of time. Don't believe this guy if you are passionate. He's probably just average  at what he does and he ptobsbly won't get very far Just follow your passion and spend hours if you feel that is important.

We tend to think writing clean code is what matters more, but it's delivering results, no one cares about the code so much except us devs in the community, clients really don't. We need to always think how what we do helps the person involved, and in what way our skill helps move their business or life forward, that really changed everything for me"

@arixrachman,"Thank you pete, it helps"
@IvanToshkov,"""Nobody cares about your code"" is the one advice from this list, that I disagree with. You forgot to mention your colleagues. They care. They'll have to deal with it! And your future self will also have to deal with your code so you better care now. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it has to be readable. The easier to read, understand and modify the code is, the better. You don't have to obsess about this, but not caring is the wrong advice.

In the recap the advice is given a bit different. Instead of ""how clean"" they said ""how clever"" your code is. Clever code is often harder to read and to modify. It's OK to have it in some places, when it's justified by some other metric, but generally you should not use it."
@jonathanjohnson2785,"Perfectionism robbed many people of even trying to code( heck, this applies to anything in life 😅). Thanks bro 👍"
@BlueFrank82,"Ok, ""perfection"" is a myth, but ""nobody does"" cannot represent an excuse to write bad code. You ""should"" always code with simplicity and readability in mind. Don't mind if others do it or not.

""Nobody cares about your code"": it's true only for non-technical stakeholders, project manager (maybe), high-level managers, and so on (and it's absolutely natural). But code quality is fundamental for all those that have to read, understand, maintain, fix and document your code. If your code smells, maintenance, testing and documentation are hard and take much longer than clean code: who pays for this?
In addition, there are cases for which the customer pretends a minimum quality threshold.

Agree with the burnout.

In my opinion, the video is too focused to a goal-oriented approach only.

So for me is a dislike."
@keharacek,"Great points you've got there!

After 4 years of professional web dev work, I've finally started to realize that it's exactly like that, that you don't need to know everything, that being curious and able to grasp new concepts quickly is the important factor. I've struggled with trying to fit the role requirements because there's always something on the list that you didn't touch at all, or that you're not that confident in yet, but I think I got to the stage that I know I can learn anything necessary for what the project needs. It's moreso the general experience of repeatedly overcoming the struggle by being persistent and being able to adapt instead of knowing it all."
@ChrisChros940,"One big lesson I learned was that when you're stuck on a problem for hours, it's best to put it aside. Take a break, go for a walk, or get some rest. When you come back, you'll likely solve it in no time."

But im pushing forward to produce my automated trading bot that tracks the entire index of Coinbase (which ive been able to pull all the data from) and have python run each trading indicator over each one every 30 seconds so over a period of 4 hours its pulled data points for all the indicators, Next comes ajusting the indicator frequencies to cater to market cap. As well as track the averaged momentum of the Histogram to work out which coin has the most volitility. and measure their SMA to find which coins will devolve into history and whats going to be around in 20 years. Which ive sucessfully managed to do this with pretty average results for now im trying to work out how to present the data so people arent trying to decipher it from a CMD shell.

Many companies take code quality and performance seriously. Tools like Cast Highlight and SonarQube are commonly used for code analysis, while performance tools like OctoPerf help ensure applications run efficiently.




If you're working at a startup, it's true that speed of delivery might take priority over perfect code. But in larger organizations—especially those focused on long-term stability and scalability—code quality is a must. They invest in tools and processes to maintain high standards because poor code leads to long-term technical debt and higher maintenance costs."

This is crucial now (THE KEY), which is why from the very beginning, I’m learning in a way that will allow me to write better code than... a Senior with 10 years of experience who led a Bootcamp (which, honestly, isn't that big of a challenge), and even better than a university profesor (now that was an intellectual challenge ;)))

Of course, this way of learning takes much more time, but any other approach doesn't make sense (and if someone has also been involved in real scientific analysis [there aren’t many such people], they’ve known this for years)."

@FirmanHerdiansyah,"I'm totally in agreement with you 100%. But I have some interesting true story. Back then, I was hired as a developer at a small startup. I was the only developer, brought in to replace the existing developer who had resigned.

In the first few days, my manager asked me to build some basic CRUD functionality, and I completed it. He looked at my code and complained about the way I was coding—not because my code was terrible, but because it wasn't perfect in his eyes. For example, he said things like ""you shouldn't use var, just use the type name directly.""

The next day, he asked lots of implementation details (not concepts) about how objects render in the browser using jQuery. I answered correctly, but he later spoke loudly in front of other employees, explaining the same implementation details he had asked me about before.

The next day, he asked me how to make some support system without proper direction, user requirements, system design, etc. I answered that I could do it in two months (even though I believed it would actually take more time). He laughed at my response. After that, he asked me not to come back tomorrow and said he would prepare a termination letter.

I went back home in shock and couldn't believe what had happened to me. Now I'm working for a multinational company, but this experience still makes me think: Is this type of person a highly talented developer who needs perfection, or just someone with NPD?

@ArsentyevYaroslav,"24 years ago, when I started coding, it wasn't impossible to know language and most of it's nuances.
10 years is beginner level still.
Most of code is mashing, not understanding, mostly.

I felt for sure my boss was going to say I didn't know enough and fire me, but I kept the same mindset that I had in school....I'd rather struggle thru the whole semester and fail than to drop the course and wonder whatif....because you never know if you might make it through with a passing grade. Don't quit because it's hard, do your best to succeed or get fired while trying. Don't be afraid to ask your boss questions if you're stuck on a problem or don't understand. Make a list of things you need to develop on your projects when starting out in your career,  as you gain experience you'll be able to freestyle your code more but at first you're going to forget alot of things that are required."

@caglarcansarikaya,"This video by Web Developete shares honest advice for self-taught developers, based on the creator's own experiences. Here are the key takeaways:

You don't need to know everything: Focus on understanding concepts and patterns, not memorizing the entire language. Google frequently – it's what developers do! (0:22)

Learn how to learn: Don't just passively consume tutorials, actively build your own projects. Practice is crucial for retention. (1:35)

Perfection is a trap: Don't strive for flawless code initially. Ship early and often, even if your code is messy. Learn from your mistakes. (2:36)

You'll never feel ready: Don't wait for the perfect moment to start building or applying for jobs. Confidence comes from action, not feeling ready. (3:46)

Problem-solving is the real skill: Coding is about breaking down problems and thinking creatively, not just writing code. Focus on understanding the ""why,"" not just the ""what."" (4:44)

Nobody cares about your code (they care about results): Write code that works and meets the client's needs, not necessarily the cleanest or most elegant code. (5:47)

Burnout is real: Protect your mental health by taking breaks, setting boundaries, and prioritizing rest. Productivity isn't about non-stop work. (6:48)

Essentially, the video encourages self-taught developers to be brave, embrace mistakes, focus on problem-solving, and prioritize well-being while navigating their journey."
@Veo360-3D,It's a conversation that would be great at a table and a cup of coffee on the side. Great video.

@EdwinMartin,"Very good tips! (old dev here)
Your client doesn’t care about your code, but… your future self does 😉"
@D-zigi,"most of them 😂
been coding for 4 years now
but working on it. 
seeking for perfection - telling myself: ""f*** it, it is working"" 
not feeling ready? applying for a big project on which most depends on my skills.
nobody cares? should they don't. everytime i change the code completely for solid purposes like data validation and error catching etc. nobody cares, stares and asks again - so what has changed, show me the results...
burnout? trying to just stand up and go touch some grass i find.
real issue is taking breaks, it is the most time consuming thing to sit straight 6 hours with just 2 of them being productive and the rest just doing blunders."
@ManiDamirchilou,I have every single problem you mentioned. Starting from perfectionism and ending with burnout. This video gave me hope. It's good to hear that i'm not the only one experiencing what i'm going through. Thanks a lot.
@Blackconnection-,"Good video. I work in dev myself since around 6 years and I can relate to alot you said.

 But to part 6 I would disagree a bit. I agree completely with the result counts. But if you are working in a team and / or you have a project that will most likely experience adjustments over and over again, to think about and use strategies, atleast in the direction like DRY and reusable code, it can save you so much time if this is written ""cleanly"" at the end. Yes it might take more time at the start, but once that setup is there and you can build upon a good foundation, this makes your debugging and adjustment life, in my view, easyer in the end. 

I am not saying having that ""foundation"" needs to be perfect. But if it is there for the most part, it can help in my view."

I recovered the project, and started the process of improvement for that game, and I started to love the process, though my code is garbage, yet I have managed to improve the code a bit with better practices, while keeping the compatibility with older stuff (I am not sure how and why they work, so I change those as little as possyble)"

You cant learn everything from tutorial , not everything is available and you get stuck and you wont know how to solve it you still need a mentor to debug your code and you end up making a project. For me i watched tutorials just for side stuff or if i am searching exact something but i do not trust i have my own mentors who are software houses owners runs their businesses and works day and night, i always bother them, plus i keep building stuff, i do search everywhere on internet how to fix the issue but just not the internet people with experience are great help."

@craigritchie8470,"One of my sayings to Jr devs is that “the client doesn’t care about your beautiful code”. But… you still have to maintain the feature so your beautiful code is for you and other devs. But you can’t tell the client it is going to take 40 hours to write beautiful code. The beautiful code has to written within the budget given by the client, so writing beautiful code has to be second nature and you have to be fast at refactoring. When I’m given a new feature I get it fully functional as fast as I can.. this is where AI shines. Doing this also gives me the opportunity to learn the nuisances of the feature, things I didn’t think about. Then with full knowledge of the feature I refactor and make it beautiful."

@Thorfinn_258,"1.I used to think it was necessary to spend hours on coding, but no breaknis required, if you clde for 4 giirs solving one problem like i did today take small rest do it in evening or the next day, give the brain a rest

2. I always wondered why can't i write a code without errors,  I can't be a good developer if i get errors but no, coding is about problem solving attitude, bugs will come AI can help but there will be certain bugs  where AI can't help you in, use your own brain to solve the problem that occurs in your code

3. Nobody cares about your code, if it's eligant or beautiful, they just want the result, if your code is messy but does exactly what the client wants, thats enough focus on the emd result not on  beautifulness of the code"

@electronicrobots8252,you will never feel ready start any way ---->I think this sentence will change my life thank you a lot
@BlessingsMkandawire-ig9dv,Love this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@conrapal5408,THank you! you are right! now give me programmer job! hahaha
@nasrinakther2491,I love this. it's amazing🌟
@abidibnazam4462,"I was struggling and questioning about myself, I know how to do things, I know how to build and ship but the mind set to feel ready was haunting me. Thanks for this advice and thanks to yt for suggesting this video on right time."
@knoxyknoxd1,"Thanks mehn.  So i just finished building  a project for my portfolio i started well and as the project grew i googled a lot and now looking at my code it feels strange .  And now am thinking should i build my portfolio website or watch a few tutorial videos maybe i will learn a few things. Mehn have been stuck since, a little doubt here and there.. This video brought some relief though . Thanks"
@Leo-fs3rj,"Thanks for the video! I’m currently learning to code and want to get started with freelancing, so these tips are really helpful."
@DeepSeekAgent301,Amen
@IyanaMoto,Perfection is a lie ❤
@soham.ambore,"As i perfectionist i believe that the line ""Don't wait for the perfect moment, ship it anyway"" really hit me hard"
@kabretenidderuon5712,"If perfection is key to success, Microsoft should be dead many years ago."
@donaldtumwesigye,"I face the ""searching everything up"" issue but instead of googling, I use ChatGPT and it adds onto my imposter syndrome but I'm learning from the solutions it provides"
@lorenzorossi7468,"The beauty of what you said so clearly is that it applies to anything you do, not just coding.

Any activity, discipline or skill you are immersed in in the long term eventually brings you to face these hurdles and come to these realisations.

What I also appreciate is that what you said is a perfectly concise, matter-of-fact, practical, personal summary of overall ""life"" advice - all without shrouding it in woo-woo mystical bs like those self-proclaimed guru types do.


Thanks"
@grub4rrr,“perfection is a lie”. I was here
@mohamed-laaguili,"thanks mate this is a valuable treasure infos .
im 2 years on the business and i what u said felt right"
@charleszzzr,"What really hits me the hardest are these phrases ""you don't need to know everything"", ""perfection is a trap"", ""nobody cares about your code"". I always thought the same and keep wondering how professionals or other people even do it, and thinking everything has to be perfect for the code to work. Also, now that I have realized that everyone only cares about what they see or if it works, it is kind of painful for me to know."
@hamzahdomeih7750,"Liked, subscribed, saved to playlist 😅"
@bowlingguy7755,"Thank you, Pete. That was really useful.
My personal experiences: (*) Break down big problems/tasks into smaller ones. (*) Get out of tutorial hell and start to code. (*) Experience comes with (lots of) practice."
@bannugopi4290,The video is very helpful Indeed. I was a graduate from cse last year and  I wanted to master DSA but never did consistently. Every month I start and stop due to other reasons and  come to day 1 of starting and  think i'm not a good coder
@user-fe2pl8ht9d,Thanks for this. I already work in IT but not in Software Development.. . Yet. Im learning to code (self-taught)
@mxxxio,"Yea, start working not watching. I think that is the most valuable quote from this video. And as soon as you start building your own projects, your remember all other quotes :D"
@gauravarya8952,Knowledge can be gathered quickly but wisdom has to be earned and it takes time. That is all I can say.
@vedarghyakundu8793,"I have started learning react and am learning it without a tutorial building a real app, thank you for the golden suggestions, you earned one more subscriber ❤. Just a question, is leveraging Llms to build components okay ? or is it better to write each component myself ?😅"
@twanajalal6493,7:29 anyone noticed the background?
@priyadarshandeshmukh8283,should be watching this video every week- over and over again
@Jakebrah,"I'm 3 months in, getting up at 4.30am every morning downing energy drinks and wayyyy to much coffee, then by 1pm i'm cooked, don't even feel like looking at a computer screen. Time to switch up the approach"
@gdogmalone,"Something overlooked and sort of relates to “Perfection Is a Trap”, is allowing yourself to be wrong and make mistakes. I’ve worked with devs who hate being wrong and being told they’ve made a mistake. You need to allow yourself to make mistakes and be wrong, it’s where you really learn. 

I firmly believe you’ll never be a good dev if you can’t accept someone pointing out bad code or improving your code."
@nostalgianid,"Thank you. Many of them really hits the spot for me. It's great advice. I'm very new at coding, especially in this world where ai is going rampant it's so easy to feel the impostor syndrome when you ask help from it sometimes, and I felt the burnout as well. i haven't felt compelled to comment in a while. Great content, great quality, and great delivery. Hope your channel will blow up!  Excited to see more! 😊😊"
@jpjp9111,"I went out intended to learn everything. I got 4 undergrad degrees: chem, physics, math, IT (network engineer, etc), and a PhD in chemistry. 
Once I got all these, I simply couldn't get a job. You know how hard it is to get a job? No one would hire me for whatever messed up reason. I'm more competitent than anyone else. 
 For the past 20 years, I couldn't get a damn job. 
It's the 2nd hardest thing to do."
@kennsr,"For me it was ""Don't think about what to write, but why its written that way"""
@RaV-ru7eb,😊 remember all.. 7:50 touch Da Grasss ... xD
@Univerx-x5u,Great Advice👍
@abdulmuhaymenali4637,I wanna say.. Thank you so much!
@reeeeel2858,I'm stuck in a thought process that devs know it better and they know it all. I'm still overthinking about it and learnt as much as i can infact even more than who actually are doing those roles but still can't be confident as i don't know it all
@codeAlongwith,Thank you for this. I am a perfectionist and this has stopped me for two decades.
@paulofernando78,Thanks for your words.
@Code-With-SuperNova,very helpfull video thanks
@mrtipbadd,I like the pacing the pacing and the tone of your voice. not a technical video yet so valuble to developers. All the points hit me but i regret more about all the time i spent on clean code and DRY code
@eliteny0,very helpful video
@Kidkromechan,"All these points are valid and relatable, and I have only been a dev for 6 years now. 
Especially the burnout. My second job taught me this too well - 6 or 7 days a week 15 hours a day coding, fixing bugs, etc. After 6 months of this, I developed some form of PTSD where just the word defect made me get cold sweat (literally). Now, I make sure to go out to the park after work for at least an hour for a walk and hit the gym some times in a week. 
I still see young graduates who don't know what burnout is trying to do their best to excel at their task like it is a university assignment but we all know that the company does not give a damn about how hard you work, its about how visible your project is and networking."
@generalchannel8833,Perfection is a trap ❤❤❤
@za1d292,"I can relate 100% to everything you're saying, and you're absolutely right."
@qutubahmed-z3g,I got hit when you say that you'll never feel ready for code ..... and also when you said that perfection is a lie.
@adriaanvanwyk5548,"Outstanding video, very inspiring and helpful. Excellent video quality and would love to have you as a mentor, you sound amazing to have as a superior😁"
@shaikmullakarimulla899,"So much Valuable suggestion for the tech / dev career you gave. I am saving this for my reminder. You spits the facts, thank you so much :)"
@Andrew-Tsegaye,GUYS YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE
@ddubb3000,Yep great advice from a 9+ yrs frontend dev I made the same mistakes!
@allencoded,"15+ years experience myself and these are on point. 

Don't short yourself because you don't know everything. For example don't neglect staff, lead or management positions because you feel you don't know it all. You will never know it all. 

Set boundaries!! I never did this one until I was so burned out that I didn't care if I was going to get fired. I started saying YES to myself and No or finding compromises to work events. At first this felt wrong, but it started making me a much better coder and human. It indirectly shows you are confident, valuable, and that you have balance. If you don't value yourself and your needs why would others?"
@Fred-lf4qb,Thanks man👍
@mrgamer-lu1im,Awesome video bro. Keep inspiring and Keep up the amazing work!
@NJM4279,"I  use Claude to  code an app, then learn the lines step-by-step"
@ilyas.s1933,"For me it was ""Don't seek the perfect framework, just pick the one that just sounds fine for you"""
@sparshv101,"Burnout, I wished someone would have told me earlier. My HR did today."
@troyhackney148,"Thank you for this, definitely points like burnout is real but also the point about no perfection really hit home. I recently delivered a project (a chat app written in python using asyncio) and have been feeling a bit exhausted after, kind of like a hangover. I took a break for a week and just binged Cyberpunk 2077 😂😂 but instead of disconnecting, I ended up going to bed far too late, so am tired all the time when it’s time for work. Now I am just trying to balance my sleep again and get on with my next course ;) 

Thanks for the video!"
@Birandoo,"Thank you! Great points. I've been studying fullstack web dev for 1,5 years and now just started applying to jobs. Luckily, the course I'm taking is focused on building things ourselves, so I'm not stuck in tutorial hell. But I've been going down that road sometimes doing side quests..."
@Danachew,I realized I knew nothing about algorithms after months of learning when I tried my first code katas 🤣
@louiskapend4530,"Thanks allot Pete, will do"
@Natnael-h5k,you will never feel real but start it any way is the gold advice i took tnx
@na-ii3ju,As a Junior Engineer this is GOLD!
@mihajlocolic01,7:28 picture on the shelf fell
@Port0101,You are informative and funny😅
@ukramedia,👏👏👏
@msntutorials.unique,Before start budiling projects please do choose the interested domain first.  I mean explore the IT roles in software development and choose the domains that suits you better
@msntutorials.unique,Bro you have shared the 100% tips to learn programming faster the most better way how everyone finally leads to the same destination to build projects.    Hey Guys if you wanna become a better programmer   just start build something which is very small gradually improve day by day from my 11 years of experience i have gained the same knowledge in the video what brother shared and in programming CONSISTENCY beats everything
@epelekanou,What will be your  advice for a new programmer to do for the portfolio?
@2gbeh,"This notion that NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR CORE is technically wrong. I care about my code, other developers on the team also care about my code, and vice versa. Writing well structured and maintainable code helps with debugging and future modifications. Anyone can get fired at anytime and someone else will be assigned to maintain your code, so please put some care into it, moreover it's the code that determines what users see. DX before UX. Except ure building a blog."
@faisalhrbk,this is literally me i want to be  a perfectionist and want to write perfect code even i didn't done a single real world project😭😭 though it's been only months since i started coding
@hashamzahid6066,Great Advices. You have a cleared a lot of my misconceptions about coding. Very motivating video.
@louiskapend4530,"Well said Pete, thank you, I always feel like I'm cheating the system by googling for answers , but now I know better"
@Dekut_tech_makers,cool stuff
@okmusic-jl5dp,thank you brother you saved my 10 + years !
@headshines,I think I needed this.. Im officailly in tutoria hell (its cool a place) but i started in JS and got a glimpse of html and css...so now that i got a good spoonful of JS im back at it in CSS learning the box model and grids... im about to jump in the deep end of the pool...
@Ghoostwallz1,6:21 😂😂 I've been there
@deacon3390,This
@amharmahushook5473,thank u sirr.. you r doing AWESOME!!♥
@zeusspiral,"its like you're reading the questions in my mind , thanks a lot pete for your effort , it helps a lot"
@FazalMalik-y4p,"This presentation’s casual, engaging tone is something I love. The presenter does a good job of keeping things interesting and informative at a good pace. In conclusion, it’s excellent."
@i.c.m7644,<3
@SazaYT,"Well said Pete, coding is most of the time problem solving, regardless if you know the ""solution"" by heart or need to google it / chat gpt etc. Its the effectiveness that matters which comes with knowledge regardless of the tools used!"
@sofros_9,polla oreo video file mou..episis i know where you got the backround paints from haha
